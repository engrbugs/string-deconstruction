0009-“He has taken on the role of puppet master,” Demeter had chided. “Deciding fates as if he were one of the Moirai himself. He should be ashamed.”
0025-The girl smiled and asked, “Vanilla latte?”
0026-“Yes,” Persephone said.
0028-“Need anything else?”
0029-Persephone met the girl’s gaze. “Do you think Lord Hades has a sense of humor?”
0030-It wasn’t a serious question, and Persephone thought it funnier than anything, but the girl’s eyes widened, and she responded, “I don’t know what you mean.”
0032-“I think he must have a sense of humor,” she explained.
0032-“The narcissus is a symbol of spring and rebirth.” Her fingers hovered over the wilted petals.
0032-If anything, the flower should be her symbol. “Why else would he claim it as his?”
0033-She stammered, “L-let me know if you need anything.”
0039-“Guess. What.”
0040-Persephone took out her headphones. “Lexa, what are you doing here?”
0041-“I was walking home from class and thought I’d stop by and tell you the good news!”
0043-“What news?” Persephone asked.
0044-“I got us into Nevernight!” Lexa could barely keep a handle on her voice, and at the mention of the famous club, several people turned to stare.
0045-“Shh!” Persephone commanded. “Do you want to get us killed?”
0046-“Don’t be ridiculous.” Lexa rolled her eyes, but she lowered her voice.
0051-“How did you manage to get on the list?” Persephone asked.
0052-“A guy at my internship can’t make it. He’s been on the waiting list for two years. Can you believe how lucky? You. Me. Nevernight. Tonight!”
0053-“I can’t go.”
0054-Lexa’s shoulders fell. “Come on, Persephone. I got us into Nevernight! I don’t want to go alone.”
0055-“Take Iris.”
0056-“I want to take you. We’re supposed to be celebrating. Besides, this is part of your college experience!”
0058-“how nice” between gritted teeth when she’d discovered the truth.
0062-“I really need to study and write a paper, Lexa. Plus, I start my internship tomorrow.”
0064-“You’ve studied!”
0066-“And we both know you’ve already written that paper. You’re just a perfectionist.”
0068-“Please, Persephone! We’ll leave early so you can get some rest.”
0069-“What am I going to do at Nevernight, Lex?”
0070-“Dance! Drink! Kiss! Maybe gamble a little? I don’t know, but isn’t that the fun of it?”
0073-“You are two things to gods,” she’d told Persephone when she was very young. “A power play or a plaything.”
0074-“Surely you are wrong, Mother. Gods love. There are several who are married.”
0075-Demeter had laughed. “Gods marry for power, my flower.”
0078-“They…age,” she’d said in disgust.
0081-“I…don’t have anything to wear,” Persephone tried weakly.
0082-“You can borrow anything from my closet. I’ll even do your hair and makeup. Please, Persephone.”
0086-“I don’t really want to meet Hades,” she said at last.
0089-“Hades won’t be there,” Lexa said. “Gods never run their own businesses!”
0092-“Is this about your mom?” she asked in a low voice.
0094-“How did you know?” It was the only thing Persephone could think to say.
0095-Lexa shrugged. “Well, you never talk about her, and she came by the apartment a couple weeks ago while you were in class.”
0096-“What?” Persephone’s mouth dropped open.
0096-This was the first time she had heard of this visit. “What did she say? Why didn’t you tell me?”
0097-“Okay, first, your mom is scary. I mean, she’s gorgeous just like you, but”—Lexa paused to shiver—“cold. “cold. Second, she told me not to tell you.”
0098-“And you listened to her?”
0099-“Well, yeah. I sorta thought she would tell you. She said she hoped to surprise you, but since you weren’t home, she’d just call.”
0101-“Did she come into our apartment?”
0102-“She asked to see your room.”
0103-“Dammit.” Persephone was going to have to check the mirrors.
0104-“Anyway, I got the sense that she’s…overprotective.”
0106-“Yeah, she’s a bitch.”
0107-“Your words, not mine.” She paused and then hedged. “Wanna talk about it?”
0108-“No,” Persephone said.
0108-She smiled. “But I’ll go with you tonight.”
0110-“Really?” Lexa clapped her hands.
0110-“Oh my gods, we’ll have so much fun, Persephone!” Lexa jumped to her feet. “We have to start getting ready!”
0111-“It’s only three.”
0112-“Uh, yeah.” Lexa pulled at her long, dark hair. “This hair is gross. Plus, it takes forever to style and now I have to do your hair and makeup too. We need to start now!”
0113-“I’ll catch up with you in a moment,” she said. “Promise.”
0114-Lexa smiled. “Thank you, Persephone. This will be great. You’ll see.”
0117-“If you report to my mother anything but what I tell you, I will kill you.”
0119-The girl cleared her throat and didn’t meet Persephone’s gaze. “If your mother discovers I lied, she’ll kill me.”
0120-“Who do you fear most?” Persephone had learned long ago that words were her most powerful weapon.
0131-“Oh my gods!” Lexa was a vision in red, and eyes tracked her all the way back to Persephone’s side. “Isn’t it gorgeous?”
0133-Persephone looked up at the tower again and frowned. “Black’s not really my color.”
0134-“You’ll sing a different tune when you lay eyes on Hades,” Lexa said.
0135-Persephone glared at her roommate. “You told me he wasn’t here!”
0136-Lexa placed her hands on Persephone’s shoulders and looked her in the eyes. “Persephone. Don’t get me wrong, you’re hot and all, but…what are the actual odds you’ll catch Hades’s attention? This place is packed.”
0138-She wasn’t aware that Lexa was watching her until she said, “You know, you can just be honest and admit you’d like to meet him.”
0139-Persephone’s laughter was shaky. “I don’t want to meet Hades.”
0143-“No! Wait! Please! I just want—I just need her back!” the man wailed as the creatures grabbed him and dragged him away.
0145-Beside her, Lexa sighed. “There’s always one.”
0147-Lexa shrugged. “What? There’s always a story in the Delphi Divine about some mortal trying to break into the Underworld to rescue their loved ones.”
0149-“But that’s impossible,” Persephone argued.
0153-“Doesn’t keep people from trying,” Lexa said.
0157-The creatures raked their gazes over Lexa and Persephone and asked, “Purses?”
0159-“How would Hades even know if some curious mortal snapped a photo?” Persephone had asked Lexa earlier when she explained the rule.
0160-“I have no idea how he knows,” Lexa admitted. “I just know that he does, and the consequences aren’t worth it.”
0161-“What are the consequences?”
0162-“A broken phone, blackballed from Nevernight, and a write-up in a gossip magazine.”
0168-“Come on!” Lexa pulled Persephone down a set of stairs to the ground floor.
0170-“Two manhattans,” Lexa ordered.
0171-A voice followed, “Drinks on me.”
0173-“Thanks,” Lexa breathed.
0174-“No problem,” he said, flashing a set of pretty, white teeth—a welcome sight compared to the ogre’s grisly fangs. “First time at Nevernight?”
0175-Lexa answered quickly, “Yes. You?”
0176-“Oh… I’m a regular here,” he said.
0177-Persephone glanced at Lexa, who blurted exactly what Persephone was thinking. “How?”
0178-“Just lucky, I guess.” He extended his hand. “Adonis.”
0179-He shook Lexa’s hand and then Persephone’s as they gave him their names. “Would you like to join my table?”
0180-“Sure,” they said in unison, giggling.
0182-“All, this is Lexa and Persephone.” Adonis pointed to his group of friends, saying their names, but Persephone only caught those who were closest to her—Aro and Xerxes were twins, sporting the same ginger hair, spray of freckles, pretty blue eyes and willow-thin bodies.
0183-“Where are you all from?” she asked.
0184-“Ionia,” Lexa said.
0185-“Olympia,” Persephone said.
0186-The girl’s eyes widened. “You lived in Olympia? I bet it was beautiful!”
0188-“It was beautiful,” Persephone agreed. “But New Athens is beautiful too. I…didn’t really have much freedom in Olympia.”
0189-Sybil offered a sympathetic smile. “Parents?”
0191-“We’re all from New Delphi, came here for college four years ago,” Aro said, gesturing to Sybil and his brother.
0192-“We like the freedom here too,” Xerxes joked.
0193-“What are you studying?” Persephone asked.
0194-“Architecture,” the boys said in unison. “College of Hestia.”
0195-“I’m in the College of the Divine.” Sybil said.
0196-“Sybil is an oracle.” Aro pointed to her with his thumb.
0198-“That means you’ll serve a god!” Lexa’s jaw dropped.
0200-“Apollo’s already got his eye on her,” said Xerxes.
0201-Sybil rolled her eyes. “It’s not as wonderful as it sounds. My family was not happy.”
0204-“Well, my parents would have been ecstatic,” Lexa said.
0205-Persephone met Sybil’s gaze. “I’m sorry they weren’t excited for you.”
0206-She shrugged. “It’s better now that I’m here.”
0220-“Looking for Hades?” Adonis joked, and Persephone’s gaze snapped to his.
0221-“Oh, no—”
0222-“I heard he was here tonight,” Lexa interrupted.
0223-Adonis laughed. “Yeah, he’s usually upstairs.”
0224-“What’s upstairs?” Persephone asked.
0225-“A lounge. It’s quieter. More intimate. I guess he prefers the peace when he’s negotiating his terms.”
0226-“Terms?” Persephone echoed.
0227-“Yeah, you know, for his contracts. Mortals come here to play him for things—money or love or whatever. The fucked-up part is, if the mortal loses, he gets to pick the stakes. And he’ll usually ask them to do something impossible.”
0228-“What do you mean?”
0229-“Apparently he can see vices or whatever. So he’ll ask the alcoholic to remain sober and the sex addict to be chaste. If they meet the terms, they get to live. If they fail, he gets their soul. It’s like he wants them to lose.”
0232-“Is anyone allowed up there?” Persephone asked.
0233-“If you’re given the password,” Adonis said.
0234-“How do you get the password?” Lexa asked.
0235-Adonis shrugged. “Hell if I know. I don’t come here to bargain with the God of the Dead.”
0237-Lexa stood, grabbing Persephone’s free hand. “Persephone, bathroom.”
0239-“Have you seen a more attractive male?” she gushed.
0240-Persephone’s brows lowered. “Adonis?”
0241-“Of course, Adonis! Who else?”
0242-Instead, she said, “You’re smitten.”
0243-“I’m in love.”
0244-Persephone rolled her eyes. “You can’t be in love. You just met him!”
0245-“Okay, maybe not love. But if he asked me to carry his babies, I’d agree.”
0246-“You are ridiculous.”
0247-“Just honest.” Lexa grinned.
0247-Then she looked at Persephone seriously and said, “It’s okay to be vulnerable, you know?”
0248-“What do you mean?” Persephone’s question was snappier than she intended.
0249-Lexa shrugged. “Never mind.”
0253-“Looking for someone?” she asked.
0254-“My friend,” Persephone said. “She was wearing red.”
0255-“She went up.” The woman tilted her chin toward the steps, and Persephone followed her gaze. “Have you been there?”
0256-“Oh, no, I haven’t,” Persephone said.
0257-“I can give you the password.”
0258-“How did you get the password?”
0259-“Here and there.” She paused. “So?”
0260-This was the thrill she’d been seeking—the adventure she craved. “Tell me.”
0261-The woman chuckled, her eyes glittering in a way that made Persephone wary. “Pathos.”
0263-“Th-thanks,” she said and headed up the spiral steps to the second floor.
0267-“Divine,” the gorgon purred.
0268-“Excuse me?” Persephone asked.
0269-“Goddess.”
0270-“You are mistaken.”
0271-The gorgon laughed. “I may have no eyes, but I know a god when I smell one. What hope have you of entering?”
0272-“You are bold for a creature who knows they speak with a goddess,” Persephone said.
0273-The gorgon smiled. “Only a goddess when it serves you?”
0274-“Pathos!” Persephone snapped.
0275-The gorgon’s smile remained, but she opened the door and asked no more questions. “Enjoy, my lady.”
0278-The dealer nodded. “Madam.”
0279-“Do you play?” a voice asked from behind her.
0283-So she smiled and said, “I’m willing to play if you’re willing to teach.”
0284-He took another drink, then approached the table, taking a seat beside her. “It’s brave to sit down at a table without knowing the game.”
0285-She met the man’s gaze. “How else would I learn?”
0286-“Hmm.” He considered, and Persephone decided she loved his voice. “Clever.”
0288-“I have never seen you before.”
0289-“Well, I’ve never been here before,” she said and paused. “You must come here often.”
0290-His lips quirked. “I do.”
0291-“Why?” she asked.
0291-She tried to recover. “I mean—you don’t have to answer that.”
0292-“I will answer it. If you will answer a question for me.”
0293-She stared at him for a moment, then nodded. “Fine.”
0294-“I come because it is…fun,” he said, but it didn’t sound like he knew what that was. “Now you—why are you here tonight?”
0295-“My friend Lexa was on the list,” she said.
0296-“No. That is the answer to a different question. Why are you here tonight?”
0297-She considered his question, then said, “It seemed rebellious at the time.”
0298-“And now you aren’t so sure?”
0299-“Oh, I am sure it’s rebellious.” Persephone dragged her finger along the surface of the table. “I’m just not sure how I’ll feel about it tomorrow.”
0300-“Who are you rebelling against?”
0301-She looked at him and smiled. “You said one question.”
0302-His smile matched hers and it made her heart beat harder in her chest. “So I did.”
0304-“Are you cold?” he asked.
0305-“What?”
0306-“You’ve been shivering since you sat down.”
0307-She felt her face redden. “Who was that woman with you earlier?”
0308-Confusion clouded his face and then cleared. “Oh, Minthe. She’s always putting her hands where they don’t belong.”
0309-Minthe sounded like a mistress, and if that was the case, she wasn’t interested. “I…think I should go.”
0311-“No,” he said, almost commanding, and Persephone glared at him.
0312-“Excuse me?”
0313-“What I mean to say is, I haven’t taught you how to play yet.” His voice lowered to a mesmerizing rumble. “Allow me.”
0314-She swallowed and managed to relax. “Then teach me.”
0315-He shuffled them, explaining, “This is poker.”
0317-“We will play five-card draw and we’ll start with a bet.”
0318-Persephone looked down at herself—she hadn’t brought her clutch, but the man was quick to say, “A question answered, then. If I win, you will answer any question I pose, and if you win, I will answer yours.”
0319-She knew what he was going to ask, but answering questions was far better than losing all her money and her soul, so she said, “Deal.”
0322-“Bluffing?” Persephone echoed.
0323-“Sometimes, poker is just a game of deception…especially when you’re losing.”
0325-“You have a pair of queens,” he said. “And I have a full house.”
0326-“So…you win,” she said.
0327-“Yes,” he replied and claimed his prize immediately. “Who are you rebelling against?”
0328-She smiled wryly. “My mother.”
0329-He raised a brow. “Why?”
0330-“You’ll have to win another hand if I’m going to answer.”
0332-She sighed. “Because…she made me mad.”
0334-She smiled. “You never said the answer had to be detailed.”
0335-His grin matched hers. “Noted for the future, I assure you.”
0336-“The future?”
0337-“Well, I hope this isn’t the last time we’ll play poker.”
0341-“Why are you angry with your mother?”
0342-“She wants me to be something I can’t.” Persephone dropped her gaze to the cards. “I don’t understand why people do this.”
0343-He tilted his head. “You are not enjoying our game?”
0344-“And now you aren’t so sure?”
0345-“Oh, I am sure it’s rebellious.” Persephone dragged her finger along the surface of the table. “I’m just not sure how I’ll feel about it tomorrow.”
0346-“Who are you rebelling against?”
0347-She looked at him and smiled. “You said one question.”
0348-His smile matched hers and it made her heart beat harder in her chest. “So I did.”
0350-“Are you cold?” he asked.
0351-“What?”
0352-“You’ve been shivering since you sat down.”
0353-She felt her face redden. “Who was that woman with you earlier?”
0354-Confusion clouded his face and then cleared. “Oh, Minthe. She’s always putting her hands where they don’t belong.”
0355-Minthe sounded like a mistress, and if that was the case, she wasn’t interested. “I…think I should go.”
0357-“No,” he said, almost commanding, and Persephone glared at him.
0358-“Excuse me?”
0359-“What I mean to say is, I haven’t taught you how to play yet.” His voice lowered to a mesmerizing rumble. “Allow me.”
0360-She swallowed and managed to relax. “Then teach me.”
0361-He shuffled them, explaining, “This is poker.”
0363-“We will play five-card draw and we’ll start with a bet.”
0364-Persephone looked down at herself—she hadn’t brought her clutch, but the man was quick to say, “A question answered, then. If I win, you will answer any question I pose, and if you win, I will answer yours.”
0365-She knew what he was going to ask, but answering questions was far better than losing all her money and her soul, so she said, “Deal.”
0368-“Bluffing?” Persephone echoed.
0369-“Sometimes, poker is just a game of deception…especially when you’re losing.”
0371-“You have a pair of queens,” he said. “And I have a full house.”
0372-“So…you win,” she said.
0373-“Yes,” he replied and claimed his prize immediately. “Who are you rebelling against?”
0374-She smiled wryly. “My mother.”
0375-He raised a brow. “Why?”
0376-“You’ll have to win another hand if I’m going to answer.”
0378-She sighed. “Because…she made me mad.”
0380-She smiled. “You never said the answer had to be detailed.”
0381-His grin matched hers. “Noted for the future, I assure you.”
0382-“The future?”
0383-“Well, I hope this isn’t the last time we’ll play poker.”
0387-“Why are you angry with your mother?”
0388-“She wants me to be something I can’t.” Persephone dropped her gaze to the cards. “I don’t understand why people do this.”
0389-He tilted his head. “You are not enjoying our game?”
0390-“I am. But…I don’t understand why people play Hades. Why do they want to sell their soul to him?”
0391-“They don’t agree to a game because they want to sell their soul,” he said. “They do it because they think they can win.”
0392-“Do they? Win?”
0393-“Sometimes.”
0394-“Does that anger him, you think?” The question was meant to remain a thought in her head, and yet the words slipped out between her lips.
0395-He smirked, and she could feel it deep in her gut. “Darling, I win either way.”
0397-“Hades.”
0399-“I have to go.”
0433-“By the gods, Mother! Can you at least use the door like a normal parent? And knock?”
0436-“Nonsense,” she said, taking Persephone’s chin between her thumb and forefinger, applying more magic.
0436-Demeter liked when Persephone resembled her, and Persephone preferred to look as little like her mother as possible. “You might be playing mortal, but you can still look Divine.”
0438-“There!” Demeter finally exclaimed, releasing her chin. “Beautiful.”
0439-Still, she managed a forced, “Thank you, Mother.”
0440-“It was nothing, my flower.” Demeter patted her cheek. “So tell me about this…job.”
0441-She was surprised by how fast and furious the anger tore through her. “It’s an internship, Mother. If I do well, I might have a job when I graduate.”
0442-Demeter frowned. “Dear, you know you do not have to work.”
0443-“So you say,” Persephone muttered under her breath.
0444-“What was that?”
0445-Persephone turned to her mother and said louder, “I want to do this. I’m good at it.”
0446-“You are good at so many things, Kore.”
0447-“Don’t call me that!” Persephone snapped, and her mother’s eyes flashed.
0449-“Sorry, Mother,” she managed, but she didn’t look at the goddess when she spoke.
0450-“Oh, my flower. I don’t blame you.” Demeter placed her hands on her daughter’s shoulders. “It’s this mortal world. It’s creating a divide between us.”
0451-“Mother, you’re being ridiculous.” Persephone sighed, placing her hands on either side of Demeter’s face, and when she spoke again, she meant every word. “You are all I have.”
0452-Instead, she said, “Remember that.”
0469-“Persephone,” she said, coming around the desk. “It’s good to see you again. Let me take you back. Demetri is expecting you.”
0471-“I saw you were from New Athens University,” Valerie said. “When do you graduate?”
0472-“In six months.”
0474-“You must be so excited.”
0475-“I am.” Persephone glanced at Valerie. “What about you? When do you graduate?”
0476-“In a couple years,” Valerie said.
0477-“And how long have you been here?”
0478-“About a year,” she said with a smile.
0479-“Do you plan to stay when you graduate?”
0480-“In the building, yes, just a few floors up at Oak & Eagle Creative,” she grinned.
0482-Valerie knocked on the open door of an office at the very back of the room. “Demetri, Persephone’s here.”
0483-“Thanks, Valerie,” Demetri said.
0485-“Persephone,” he said, coming around his desk and stretching out his hand. “It’s good to see you again. We are happy to have you.”
0486-“I’m happy to be here, Mr. Aetos,” she said as she took his hand.
0487-“Call me Demetri.”
0488-“Okay…Demetri.” She couldn’t help smiling.
0489-“Please, sit!” He indicated a chair, and she took a seat.
0489-Demetri leaned against his desk, hands in his pockets. “Tell me about yourself.”
0490-“Well, I’m a student at New Athens University. I’m majoring in journalism and I’ll graduate in May…” she started, and Demetri waved his hand.
0491-“Not what’s on your resume.”
0493-He smiled. “What about you—your hobbies, interests…?”
0494-“Oh.” She blushed and thought for a moment. “I like baking. It helps me relax.”
0495-“Oh? Tell me more. What do you like to bake?”
0496-“Anything, really. I’ve been challenging myself at sugar cookie art.”
0497-His brows rose and his smile stayed. “Sugar cookie art, huh? That’s a thing?”
0498-“Yes, I’ll show you.”
0500-Demetri took the phone and swiped through the photos. “Oh, nice. These are great, Persephone.”
0502-“Thank you.” Persephone hated the cheesy smile those words brought to her face, but no one but Lexa had ever told her that.
0503-“So you like to bake. What else?”
0504-“I like to write,” she said. “Stories.”
0505-“Stories? Like fiction?”
0506-“Yes.”
0507-“Romance?” he guessed.
0508-It was what most people assumed, and the blush on Persephone’s cheeks wasn’t helping her case. “No, actually. I like mysteries.”
0509-“Unexpected,” he said. “I like it. What do you hope to gain from this internship?”
0510-“Adventure.” She couldn’t help it.
0511-“Adventure.” He pushed away from his desk. “If adventure is what you desire, New Athens News can give it to you, Persephone. This position can look like anything you wish—it’s yours to craft and manage. If you want to report, you can report. If you want to edit, you can edit. If you want to get coffee, you get coffee.”
0513-“I’m sure you know that we find ourselves in the media a lot,” he smiled wryly. “Ironic, considering we are a news source.”
0515-“I couldn’t believe when Apollo accused you of being members of Triad,” Persephone said.
0517-“Oh yeah.” Demetri raised his brows and rubbed the back of his neck. “Completely ludicrous, of course, but that didn’t keep people from believing it.”
0519-“We seek truth, Persephone,” Demetri said. “There’s power in truth. Do you want power?”
0521-“Yes,” she said. “I want power.”
0522-This time when Demetri smiled, he showed his teeth. “Then you will do well here.”
0524-“Adonis,” she said.
0525-“Persephone.” He looked just as handsome as he had last night, only more professional with his lavender button-up and coffee cup clutched in one hand. “I had no idea you were our new intern.”
0526-“I had no idea you worked here,” she said.
0527-“I’m a senior reporter, mostly focused on entertainment,” he said rather smugly. “We missed you when you left last night.”
0528-“Oh, yes, sorry. I wanted to prepare for my first day.”
0529-“Not going to fault you for that. Well, welcome.”
0530-“Adonis,” Demetri called as he stepped back into the doorframe of his office. “Mind giving Persephone here a tour of our floor?”
0531-“Not at all.” Adonis smiled at her. “Ready?”
0533-“We call this the workroom. It’s where everyone follows leads and investigates,” he said.
0535-“Interview and conference rooms. Break room. Lounge.” He pointed to a huge room with various casual sitting areas and warm, low light.
0535-It was cozy, and there were already several people nesting. “You’ll probably prefer to write in here when you get the chance.”
0536-While he helped her carry her supplies back to her desk, he asked, “So what kind of journalism are you interested in?”
0537-“I’m leaning toward investigative reporting,” she said.
0538-“Oh, a detective, huh?”
0539-“I like research.”
0540-“Any subject in particular?” he asked.
0542-“So you like to bake. What else?”
0543-“I like to write,” she said. “Stories.”
0544-“Stories? Like fiction?”
0545-“Yes.”
0546-“Romance?” he guessed.
0547-It was what most people assumed, and the blush on Persephone’s cheeks wasn’t helping her case. “No, actually. I like mysteries.”
0548-“Unexpected,” he said. “I like it. What do you hope to gain from this internship?”
0549-“Adventure.” She couldn’t help it.
0550-“Adventure.” He pushed away from his desk. “If adventure is what you desire, New Athens News can give it to you, Persephone. This position can look like anything you wish—it’s yours to craft and manage. If you want to report, you can report. If you want to edit, you can edit. If you want to get coffee, you get coffee.”
0552-“I’m sure you know that we find ourselves in the media a lot,” he smiled wryly. “Ironic, considering we are a news source.”
0554-“I couldn’t believe when Apollo accused you of being members of Triad,” Persephone said.
0556-“Oh yeah.” Demetri raised his brows and rubbed the back of his neck. “Completely ludicrous, of course, but that didn’t keep people from believing it.”
0558-“We seek truth, Persephone,” Demetri said. “There’s power in truth. Do you want power?”
0560-“Yes,” she said. “I want power.”
0561-This time when Demetri smiled, he showed his teeth. “Then you will do well here.”
0563-“Adonis,” she said.
0564-“Persephone.” He looked just as handsome as he had last night, only more professional with his lavender button-up and coffee cup clutched in one hand. “I had no idea you were our new intern.”
0565-“I had no idea you worked here,” she said.
0566-“I’m a senior reporter, mostly focused on entertainment,” he said rather smugly. “We missed you when you left last night.”
0567-“Oh, yes, sorry. I wanted to prepare for my first day.”
0568-“Not going to fault you for that. Well, welcome.”
0569-“Adonis,” Demetri called as he stepped back into the doorframe of his office. “Mind giving Persephone here a tour of our floor?”
0570-“Not at all.” Adonis smiled at her. “Ready?”
0572-“We call this the workroom. It’s where everyone follows leads and investigates,” he said.
0574-“Interview and conference rooms. Break room. Lounge.” He pointed to a huge room with various casual sitting areas and warm, low light.
0574-It was cozy, and there were already several people nesting. “You’ll probably prefer to write in here when you get the chance.”
0575-While he helped her carry her supplies back to her desk, he asked, “So what kind of journalism are you interested in?”
0576-“I’m leaning toward investigative reporting,” she said.
0577-“Oh, a detective, huh?”
0578-“I like research.”
0579-“Any subject in particular?” he asked.
0582-“No, I just…like to solve mysteries,” she answered.
0583-“Well then, maybe you can help us figure out who’s been stealing lunches from the fridge in the break room.”
0590-“Hello!” she called. “Anyone there?”
0592-“What do you want?” His words were a snarl, and it wasn’t lost on her that he could crush her skull with his hand alone.
0593-“I must speak with Hades,” she said.
0596-She banged on the door again. “Bastard! Let me in!”
0599-“I demand you let me in!” She curled her fingers into her palms.
0600-“Who are you, mortal, to demand an audience with the God of the Dead?” the creature asked.
0601-“Your lord has placed a mark on me, and I will have words with him.”
0603-“You would have words with him?”
0604-“Yes, me. Let me in!”
0606-“We are not open,” the creature responded. “You will have to come back.”
0607-“I will not come back. You will let me in now, you big, ugly ogre!”
0609-“What are you?” he demanded. “A tricky little nymph?”
0612-“I am Persephone, Goddess of Spring, and if you would like to keep your fleeting life, then you will obey me.”
0617-“Lady Persephone.” His voice was heavy and seductive, and she shivered.
0619-“Lord Hades,” she managed with a curt nod.
0620-“My lord.” The ogre hung his head. “I did not know she was a goddess. I accept punishment for my actions.”
0621-“Punishment?” Persephone echoed, feeling increasingly exposed in the daylight outside the club.
0622-“I laid my hands upon a goddess,” the monster said.
0623-“And a woman at that,” Hades added unhappily.
0623-“I will deal with you later. Now, Lady Persephone.” He stepped aside and let her enter Nevernight.
0625-Then he spoke against her ear, his lips brushing feather-light over her skin. “You are full of surprises, darling.”
0627-“After you, Goddess,” he said.
0631-“Where are we going?” she asked.
0632-He paused and turned toward her. “My office. I imagine that whatever you have to say to me demands privacy?”
0633-She opened and closed her mouth, looking around the empty club. “This seems pretty private.”
0634-“It isn’t,” he said and headed up the stairs without another word.
0638-This time, he called her out. “Will you hesitate at every turn, Lady Persephone?”
0639-She glared. “I was just admiring your decor, Lord Hades. I didn’t notice this last night.”
0640-“The doors to my quarters are often veiled during business hours,” he replied and then indicated the open door. “Shall we?”
0647-“Are you hurt?” he asked.
0648-“No,” she said, and he nodded, carefully pulling his arm free of her grasp.
0650-“Oh, it’s a little too late to be modest, don’t you think?” Hades said, piercing her with those beautiful dark eyes.
0652-She swallowed. “Did I interrupt something?”
0654-The corner of his mouth lifted. “I was just about to go to bed when I heard you demanding entrance to my club.”
0656-“Imagine my surprise when I find the goddess from last night on my doorstep.”
0657-“Did the gorgon tell you?”
0659-“No. Euryale did not. I recognized your magic as Demeter’s, but you are not Demeter.” Then he tilted his head again. “When you left, I consulted a few texts. I had forgotten Demeter had a daughter. I assumed you were Persephone. Question is, why aren’t you using your own magic?”
0660-“Is that why you did this?” she demanded, removing the bracelet she’d used to cover the mark on her skin and holding up her arm.
0664-“No,” he said. “That is the result of losing against me.”
0665-“You were teaching me to play,” she argued.
0666-“Semantics,” he shrugged. “The rules of Nevernight are very clear, Goddess.”
0667-“They are anything but clear, and you are an asshole!”
0669-“Don’t call me names, Persephone,” he said and then reached for her wrist.
0669-He traced the bracelet all around, making her shiver. “When you invited me to your table, you entered into an agreement. If you had won, you could have left Nevernight with no demands on your time. But you didn’t, and now we have a contract.”
0671-“And what does that mean?” Her voice was still biting.
0672-“It means I must choose terms.”
0673-“I don’t want to be in a contract with you,” she said between her teeth. “Take it off!”
0674-“I can’t.”
0675-“You put it there. You can remove it.”
0677-“You think this is funny?”
0678-“Oh, darling, you have no idea.”
0680-“I am a goddess,” she tried again. “We are equals.”
0681-“You think our blood changes the fact that you willingly entered into a contract with me? These things are law, Persephone.” She glared at him.
0681-“The mark will dissolve when the contract has been fulfilled.” He said it like that should make it all better.
0682-“And what are your terms?” Just because she was asking didn’t mean she was going to agree.
0684-“Create life in the Underworld,” he said at last.
0685-“What?” She hadn’t been prepared for that, though she probably should have been.
0686-“Create life in the Underworld,” he said again. “You have six months—and if you fail or refuse, then you will become a permanent resident of my realm.”
0687-“You want me to grow a garden in your realm?” she demanded.
0688-He shrugged again. “I suppose that is one way to create life.”
0689-She glared at him. “If you steal me away to the Underworld, you will face my mother’s wrath.”
0690-“Oh, I am sure,” he mused. “Much like you will feel her wrath when she discovers what you’ve so recklessly done.”
0692-“Fine.” She felt the pressure of Hades’s hand on her wrist like a shackle and tore her hand free. “When do I start?”
0693-Hades’s eyes glittered. “Come tomorrow. I’ll show you the way to the Underworld.”
0694-“It will have to be after class,” she said.
0695-“Class?”
0696-“I’m a student at New Athens University.”
0697-Hades looked at her curiously and nodded his head. “After…class, then.”
0698-As much as she hated him right now, it was hard not to enjoy the sight of him. “What about your bouncer?”
0699-“What about him?”
0700-“I’d prefer he not remember me in this form.” She lifted her hand to her horns, then called up her glamour.
0701-Hades watched the transformation as if he were studying the form of an ancient sculpture. “I’ll erase his memory…after he is punished for his treatment of you.”
0702-Persephone shivered. “He didn’t know I was a goddess.”
0703-“But he knew you were a woman and he let his anger get the best of him. So he will be punished.” Hades said it as matter-of-fact, and she knew there was no arguing.
0704-“What will it cost me?” she asked, because she knew who she was dealing with, and she had just requested a favor from the God of the Dead.
0705-His lips twitched. “Clever, darling. You know how this works. The punishment? Nothing. His memory? A favor.”
0706-“Don’t call me darling,” she snapped. “What kind of favor?”
0707-“Whatever I want,” he said. “To be used at a future time.”
0708-Either way, she said, “Deal.”
0709-Hades smiled. “I will have my driver take you home.”
0710-“That’s not necessary.”
0711-“It is.”
0712-“Fine,” she gritted out.
0714-“What was that for?” she asked, her voice a whisper.
0716-“For your benefit. Next time, the door will open for you. I’d rather you not piss Duncan off. If he hurts you again, I will have to kill him, and it’s hard to find a good ogre.”
0718-“Lord Hades, Thanatos is looking for you—oh—”
0721-“I did not know you had company,” Minthe added tightly.
0722-Instead, his eyes remained on Persephone. “A minute, Minthe.”
0726-“You haven’t answered my question,” Hades said. “Why are you using your mother’s magic?”
0727-“Lord Hades,” she said, drawing a finger down his chest.
0727-She wasn’t sure what made her do it, but she was feeling brave. “The only way you are getting answers from me is if I decide to enter into another gamble with you, and at the moment, it’s not likely.”
0728-She looked up at him and whispered. “I think you will regret this, Hades.”
0735-“Lady Persephone, this is Antoni,” Hades said. “He will ensure you make it home safe.”
0736-Persephone raised a brow at the God of the Underworld. “Am I in danger, my lord?”
0737-“Just a precaution. I wouldn’t want your mother banging down my door before she has a reason to.”
0740-“My lady,” Antoni said, opening the rear car door.
0741-“My lord.” She nodded to Hades as she twisted from him and slid into the black leather interior.
0747-“Will you be returning to visit Lord Hades?” Antoni asked, glancing in the rearview mirror.
0748-“I’m afraid I will,” Persephone said absently.
0749-“I hope you’ll find him pleasing. Our lord is often alone.”
0750-Persephone found those words strange, especially in light of the jealous Minthe. “He doesn’t seem so alone to me.”
0751-“Such is the case with the Divine, but I am afraid he trusts very few. If you ask me, he needs a wife.”
0752-Persephone blushed. “I am certain Lord Hades isn’t interested in settling down.”
0753-“You’d be surprised by what the God of the Dead is interested in,” Antoni replied.
0756-“How long have you been in service to Hades?”
0757-“The Three freed my kind from Tartarus after we were placed there by Cronos,” he replied. “And so we have repaid the favor by serving Zeus, Poseidon, and Hades from time to time.”
0758-“As a driver?” She didn’t mean to sound so repulsed, but it seemed a menial task.
0759-Antoni laughed. “Yes, but our kind are great builders and blacksmiths too. We have crafted gifts for the Three and shall continue.”
0760-“But that was so long ago. Surely you’ve repaid their favor?” Persephone asked.
0761-“When the God of the Dead gives you life, it is a favor that will never be repaid.”
0762-Persephone frowned. “I don’t understand.”
0763-“You have never been to Tartarus, so I don’t expect that you will.” He paused, then added, “Do not misunderstand. “Do not misunderstand. My service to Hades is my choice, and of all the gods, I am glad to serve him. He is not like the other Divine.”
0766-“Oh, you don’t have to—I can open my own door,” she said.
0767-He smiled. “It is my pleasure, Lady Persephone.”
0768-She started to ask him not to call her that but then realized he was using her title, as if he knew she was a goddess, yet she wore her glamour. “How did you—”
0769-“Lord Hades called you Lady Persephone,” he explained. “So I will too.”
0770-“Please…it’s not necessary.”
0771-His smile widened. “I think you should get used to it, Lady Persephone, especially if you visit us often, as I hope you will.”
0774-“Uh, whose Lexus dropped you off in front of our lame apartment?” she asked.
0776-“Well…you’re never going to believe this but…Hades.”
0778-“Are you kidding?” Persephone shook her head and moved to grab a broom; Lexa followed. “Like…the Hades? God of the Dead Hades? Owner of Nevernight Hades?”
0779-“Yes, Lexa. Who else?”
0780-“How?” she sputtered. “Why?”
0781-“It was for my job.” It wasn’t technically a lie.
0782-“And you met Hades? You saw him in the flesh?”
0783-“Yeah.” She turned away from Lexa and grabbed the dustpan, trying to hide the furious blush staining her cheeks.
0784-“What does he look like? Details. Spill!”
0785-Persephone handed Lexa the dustpan, and she held it as Persephone swept up the shattered mug. “I…don’t know where to begin.”
0786-Lexa smiled. “Start with his eyes.”
0789-“He’s handsome,” she said, though even that word didn’t do him justice.
0789-It wasn’t just his looks; it was his presence. “He’s…power.”
0790-“Someone has a crush.” The smug smirk on Lexa’s face reminded Persephone that she was too focused on what the god looked like and not enough on what he did.
0791-“What? No. No. Look, Hades is handsome. I’m not blind, but I can’t condone what he does.”
0792-“What do you mean?”
0793-“The bargains, Lex!” Persephone reminded Lexa of what they’d learned from Adonis at Nevernight. “He preys upon desperate mortals.”
0794-Lexa shrugged. “Well, you could ask Hades about it.”
0795-“We’re not friends, Lexa.” They would never be friends.
0796-Then Lexa bounced on her feet. “Oh! What if you wrote about him? You could investigate his bargains with mortals! How scandalous!”
0799-“Looks like you have another reason to visit Hades,” Lexa said, and Persephone broke into a smile.
0805-“That is one way,” he’d said.
0821-“It’s just that the Fates have chosen a different path for you, my flower,” Demeter had said when Persephone’s magic never manifested.
0822-“What path?” Persephone asked. “There is no path, only the walls of your glass prison! Do you keep me hidden away because you’re ashamed?”
0823-“I keep you safe because you have no power, my flower. There is a difference.”
0826-“Mother,” Persephone said when Demeter appeared beside her.
0828-“What are you doing here?” Persephone asked.
0829-“Where were you yesterday?” Demeter’s voice was curt.
0830-“It sounds like you already think you know the answer, so why don’t you tell me?”
0831-“Do not treat this with sarcasm, my dear. This is very serious—why were you at Nevernight?”
0832-Had a nymph seen her? “How do you know I was at Nevernight?”
0833-“Never mind how I knew. I asked you a question.”
0834-“I went for work, Mother. I must return today too.”
0835-“Absolutely not,” Demeter said. “Need I remind you a condition of your time here was that you stay away from the gods? Especially Hades.”
0836-She said his name like a curse, and Persephone flinched. “Mother, I have to do this. It’s my job.”
0837-“Then you will quit.”
0838-“No.”
0839-Persephone was sure that in all her twenty-four years, she’d never told her mother no. “What did you say?”
0840-“I like my life, Mother. I’ve worked hard to get where I am.”
0841-“Persephone, you do not need to live this mortal life. It is…changing you.”
0842-“Good. That’s what I want. I want to be me, whatever that is, and you’re going to have to accept that.”
0844-“I have heeded your warnings about the gods, especially Hades,” Persephone added. “What are you afraid of? That I’ll allow him to seduce me? Have more faith in me.”
0845-Demeter paled and hissed, “This is serious, Persephone.”
0846-“I am being serious, Mother.” She checked her watch. “I have to go. I’ll be late for class.”
0853-“What’s wrong?”
0854-Finally, she said, “I found out my mom’s been tracking me. She…sorta found out about Nevernight.”
0855-Lexa rolled her eyes. “Doesn’t she realize you’re an adult?”
0856-“I don’t think my mother has ever seen me as an adult.” And she didn’t think she ever would, evident by her use of the nickname Kore.
0857-“Don’t let her make you feel bad for having fun, Persephone. Definitely don’t let her keep you from doing what you want.”
0860-“Hey,” he said and smiled. “Lexa, right? It’s good to see you again.”
0862-Lexa grinned. “I couldn’t believe it when Persephone told me she worked with you. What a coincidence.”
0863-He looked at Persephone. “It was definitely a pleasant surprise. You know what they say, small world, huh?”
0864-“Adonis, a moment?” Demetri called from his doorway, and they all looked in his direction.
0865-“Coming!” Adonis glanced back at Lexa. “Good to see you. Let’s all go out sometime.”
0866-“Careful, we’ll hold you to that,” she warned.
0867-“I hope you do.”
0868-Adonis hurried off to join Demetri, and Lexa looked at Persephone. “Tell me—is he as handsome as Hades?”
0869-She also didn’t mean to offer a resounding “No.”
0871-Lexa raised a brow and smiled, then leaned forward and pecked Persephone on the cheek. “I’ll see you tonight. Oh, and make sure you follow up with Adonis. He’s right—we should go out together.”
0873-When she returned to her desk, Adonis stepped out of Demetri’s office. “So about this weekend.”
0874-“This weekend?” she echoed.
0875-“I thought we could go to the Trials,” he said. “You know, with Lexa. I’ll invite Aro, Xerxes, and Sybil.”
0876-Persephone had never been, but she’d seen and read coverage in the past. “Oh… Well, actually, before we discuss that, I was hoping you might help me with something.”
0877-Adonis brightened. “Sure. What’s up?”
0878-“Has anyone here ever written about the God of the Dead?”
0879-Adonis laughed, then stopped himself. “Oh, you’re serious?”
0880-“Very.”
0881-“I mean, it’s kind of hard.”
0882-“Why?”
0883-“Because it’s not like Hades forces these humans into gambling with him. They do so willingly and then face the consequences.”
0884-“That doesn’t mean the consequences are right or even fair,” Persephone argued.
0885-“No, but no one wants to end up in Tartarus, Persephone.”
0887-“Look…if you’re serious about this, I can send you what I have on him.”
0888-“You’d do that?” she asked.
0889-“Of course,” he said and grinned. “On one condition—you let me read the article you write.”
0890-She had no problem sending Adonis her article and welcomed the feedback. “Deal.”
0894-An hour in, Adonis dropped by to check on her. “Finding any of it useful?”
0895-“I want to interview Hades,” she said. “Today, if possible.”
0897-Adonis paled. “You want to…what?”
0898-“I’d like to give Hades a chance to offer his side of things,” she explained.
0898-Everything Adonis had on him was from the perspective of the mortal, and she was curious how the god saw bargains and mortals and their vices. “You know, before I write my article.”
0899-Adonis blinked a couple times and finally found his words. “That’s not how this works, Persephone. You can’t just show up at a god’s place of business and demand an audience. There’s a… There are rules.”
0900-She raised a brow and crossed her arms over her chest. “Rules?”
0901-“Yes, rules. We have to submit a request to his PR manager.”
0902-“A request that will be denied, I’m assuming?”
0904-“Look, if we go there, at least we can say we tried to reach him for comment and he denied us. I can’t write this article without trying, and I don’t want to wait.”
0906-After a moment, Adonis sighed. “Okay. I’ll let Demetri know we’re heading out.”
0907-He started to turn, and Persephone stopped him. “You haven’t…told Demetri about this, have you?”
0908-“Not that you plan to write this article.”
0909-“Can we keep it a secret? For now?”
0910-Adonis smiled. “Yeah, sure. Whatever you want, Persephone.”
0913-Adonis came up beside her. “Looks different in the daylight, huh?”
0914-“Yeah,” she said absently.
0915-Adonis tried the door, but it was locked, so he knocked and offered no time for someone to answer before retreating. “Looks like no one’s home.”
0918-“Yes!” she hissed to herself.
0919-Adonis looked back at her, puzzled. “How did you… It was locked!”
0920-She shrugged. “Maybe you didn’t pull hard enough. Come on.”
0921-As she disappeared into Nevernight, she heard Adonis say, “I swear it was locked.”
0923-“Hello? Anybody home?” Adonis called.
0927-“Can I help you?” Minthe had an inviting and smoky voice, but it didn’t hide the sharpness of her tone.
0928-“Hi.” Adonis brushed past Persephone, suddenly finding his confidence and extending his hand.
0928-Persephone was surprised and slightly frustrated when Minthe took his hand and offered a smile. “Adonis.”
0929-“Minthe.”
0930-“Do you work here?” he asked.
0931-“I am Lord Hades’s assistant,” she replied.
0933-“Really?” Adonis sounded genuinely surprised. “But you’re so beautiful.”
0936-“Uh…and this is Persephone.” He gestured to her.
0936-Minthe said nothing; she didn’t even nod. “We’re from New Athens News.”
0937-“So you’re a reporter?” Her eyes flashed, and Adonis probably took it as interest in his occupation, but Persephone knew otherwise.
0938-“We’re actually here to speak with Hades,” she said. “Is he around?”
0939-Minthe’s eyes burned into her. “Do you have an appointment with Lord Hades?”
0940-“No.”
0941-“Then I’m afraid you cannot speak to him.”
0942-“Oh, well, that’s too bad,” Adonis said. “We’ll come back when we have an appointment. Persephone?”
0943-“Inform your lord that Persephone is here and would like to speak with him.” It was a command, but Minthe smiled, unfazed, looking at Adonis.
0944-“Your counterpart must be new and therefore ignorant to how this works. See, Lord Hades does not give interviews.”
0945-“Of course.” Adonis wrapped his fingers around Persephone’s wrist. “Let’s go, Persephone. I told you, there is a protocol we need to follow.”
0946-She wasn’t sure what look she gave him, but her eyes burned, and anger rose hot in her blood. “Let. Me. Go.”
0948-“I am not ignorant of how this works,” Persephone said. “But I demand to speak with Hades.”
0949-“Demand?” Minthe crossed her arms over her chest, brows rising to her hairline, and smiled wickedly. “Fine. I’ll tell him you demand to see him, but only because I will take great satisfaction in hearing him turn you away.”
0951-“Why would Hades know your name?” Adonis asked.
0952-She didn’t look at him as she replied, “I met him the same night I met you.”
0955-She lifted her chin and said tightly, “Follow me.”
0962-Minthe paused and nodded. “Persephone, my lord.”
0963-She shifted, turning to face Persephone again, standing just behind the god. “And…her friend, Adonis.”
0964-Hades’s gaze slid to her counterpart and darkened before he nodded to Minthe. “You are dismissed, Minthe. Thank you.”
0967-“To what do I owe this…intrusion?” he asked.
0969-“Lord Hades,” she said and took her notebook out of her purse, where she’d written down the names of every victim who had called the paper with a complaint. “Adonis and I are from New Athens News. We have been investigating several complaints about you and wondered if you might comment.”
0970-Beside her, Adonis offered a nervous laugh. “Persephone is investigating. I’m just…here for moral support.”
0972-“Is that a list of my offenses?” Hades’s eyes were dark and void of emotion.
0973-After a moment, she looked up. “Do you remember these people?”
0974-He took a languid sip of his liquor. “I remember every soul.”
0975-“And every bargain?”
0976-His eyes narrowed and he studied her a moment. “The point, Persephone. Get to the point. You’ve had no trouble with it in the past. Why now?”
0977-He made it sound like they’d known each other far longer than two days. “You agree to offer mortals whatever they desire if they gamble with you and win.”
0978-“Not all mortals and not all desires,” he said.
0979-“Oh, forgive me. You are selective in the lives you destroy.”
0980-His face hardened. “I do not destroy lives.”
0981-“You only make the terms of your contract known after you’ve won! That’s deception.”
0982-“The terms are clear; the details are mine to determine. It is not deception, as you call it. It is a gamble.”
0983-“You challenge their vice. You lay their darkest secrets bare—”
0984-“I challenge what is destroying their life. It is their choice to conquer or succumb.”
0985-He spoke in such a matter-of-fact tone, as if he’d had this conversation thousands of times. “And how do you know their vice?”
0986-“I see to the soul,” he said. “What burdens it, what corrupts it, what destroys it—and challenge it.”
0989-And then she snapped. “You are the worst sort of god!”
0991-“Persephone—” Adonis warned, but Hades’s warm baritone quickly drowned him out.
0992-“I am helping these mortals.” He took a deliberate step toward her.
0993-“How? By offering an impossible bargain? Abstain from addiction or lose your life? That’s absolutely ridiculous, Hades.”
0994-“I have had success,” he argued.
0995-“Oh? And what is your success? I suppose it doesn’t matter to you as you win either way, right? All souls come to you at some point.”
0997-“What did you do?” Persephone started to reach for him, but Hades grabbed her wrists, keeping her on her feet and drawing her into him.
0998-His breath caressed her lips as he spoke. “I’m assuming you don’t want him to hear what I have to say to you. Don’t worry. I won’t request a favor when I erase his memory.”
0999-“Oh, how kind of you,” she mocked, craning her neck to meet his gaze.
1000-“What liberties you take with my favor, Lady Persephone.” His voice was low—too low for this kind of conversation.
1001-“You never specified how I had to use your favor.”
1002-His eyes narrowed a fraction. “I didn’t, though I expected you to know better than to drag this mortal into my realm.”
1003-It was her turn to narrow her eyes. “Do you know him?”
1004-Hades ignored the question. “You plan to write a story about me? Tell me, Lady Persephone, will you detail your experiences with me? How you recklessly invited me to your table, begged me to teach you cards—”
1005-“I did not beg!”
1006-“Will you speak of how you flush from your pretty head to your toes in my presence and how I make you lose your breath—”
1007-“Shut up!”
1008-As he spoke, he leaned closer. “Will you speak of the favor I have given you, or are you too ashamed?”
1009-“Stop!”
1010-She pulled away, and he released her, but he was not through. “You may blame me for the choices you made, but it changes nothing. You are mine for six months—and that means, if you write about me, I will ensure there are consequences.”
1012-“It is true what they say about you,” she said, her chest rising and falling. “You heed no prayer. You offer no mercy.”
1013-Hades’s face remained blank. “No one prays to the God of the Dead, my lady, and when they do, it is too late.”
1014-“S-sorry,” he said.
1015-“I will answer no more of your questions,” Hades said. “Minthe will show you out.”
1017-“Persephone.” Hades’s voice commanded her attention as she and Adonis turned to leave.
1017-She paused at the door and looked back. “I shall add your name to my guest list this evening.”
1021-Once they were outside Nevernight, Adonis muttered. “Well, that was interesting.”
1023-“You said you only met Hades once before?” Adonis asked as they got into his car.
1024-“Huh?”
1025-“Hades, you’ve met him once before?”
1027-“Yes,” she admitted hesitantly. “Why?”
1028-He shrugged. “There just seemed to be a lot of tension between you two, like…you have a history.”
1030-“Persephone?” Adonis asked.
1031-She took a breath. “No. We don’t have history.”
1038-“My name is—” she started.
1039-“You need not introduce yourself, my lady,” the ogre said.
1041-She met the ogre’s gaze. “What is your name?”
1042-The creature looked surprised. “Mekonnen, my lady.”
1043-“Mekonnen,” she smiled. “Call me Persephone, please.”
1044-His eyes widened. “My lady—I couldn’t. Lord Hades, he would—”
1045-“I will speak with Lord Hades.” She placed her hand on the ogre’s arm. “Call me Persephone.”
1046-Mekonnen offered a crooked smile and then swept his hand out in a dramatic fashion, bowing at the waist. “Persephone.”
1047-“my lady” again, she’d see that as a victory.
1049-“Lady Persephone?” he asked.
1050-“Just Persephone,” she said. “Please.”
1051-“Apologies, Lady Persephone. I speak as Lord Hades commands.”
1052-“Lord Hades has no say over how I am to be addressed.” She smiled. “Persephone it is.”
1053-The corners of his lips curled. “I like you already. I am Ilias. Lord Hades wishes me to apologize on his behalf. He is otherwise engaged and has advised me to show you to his office. He promises he will not be long.”
1054-Perhaps he was sealing another terrible contract with a mortal…or with Minthe. “I’ll just wait at the bar.”
1055-“I’m afraid that will not do.”
1056-“Another command?” she asked.
1057-Ilias offered an apologetic smile. “I’m afraid this one must be obeyed, Persephone.”
1058-She smiled at the satyr. “Only for you, then. Lead the way.”
1059-He walked to the bar where Hades had served himself earlier in the day. “Can I get you anything? Wine, perhaps?”
1060-“Yes, please. A cab, if you have it.” If she was going to spend the evening with Hades and in the Underworld, she wanted a drink in her hand.
1061-“Coming right up!”
1063-After a moment, she asked, “Why do you serve Hades?”
1064-“I do not serve Lord Hades. I work for him. There is a difference.”
1065-Fair enough. “Why do you work for him, then?”
1066-“Lord Hades is very generous,” the satyr explained. “Don’t believe everything you hear about him. Most of it isn’t true.”
1067-That piqued her interest. “Tell me something that isn’t true.”
1069-“Thank you.”
1070-“My pleasure.” He bowed his head a little, placing his hand against his chest.
1070-When he looked at her again, she was surprised by his seriousness. “They say Hades is protective of his realm, and while that is true, it isn’t about power. He cares for his people, protects them, and he takes it personally if anyone is harmed. If you belong to him, he will tear the world apart to save you.”
1071-She shivered. “But I don’t belong to him.”
1072-“Yes, you do, or I wouldn’t be serving you wine in his office.” He bowed. “If you require anything, you must simply speak my name.”
1107-“You’re a god,” she said, surprised.
1108-He smiled, showing a set of dimples on either side of his face. “I am.”
1109-“You’re not Hades.”
1110-“No.” He looked amused. “I am Hermes.”
1111-“Ah,” she said and laid her head back down.
1112-“Ah?”
1113-“Yes, ah.”
1114-He grinned. “So you’ve heard of me?”
1115-She rolled her eyes. “The God of Trickery and Thieves.”
1116-“I beg your pardon. You forgot trade, commerce, merchants, roads, sports, travelers, athletes, heraldry…”
1117-“How could I have forgotten heraldry?” she asked absently and then shivered, staring up at the dim sky.
1118-“You’re cold?” he asked.
1119-“Well, I was just pulled from a river.”
1121-She flushed. “Thank you.”
1122-“It is my pleasure,” he said, still watching her. “Shall I guess who you are?”
1123-“Oh yes. Entertain yourself,” she said.
1124-Hermes looked serious for a moment and tapped his full lips with his finger. “Hmm. I think you are the Goddess of Sexual Frustration.”
1125-Persephone barked laughter. “I think that’s Aphrodite.”
1126-“Did I say sexual frustration? I meant Hades’s sexual frustration.”
1129-“Why did you do that?” she demanded.
1130-“You try my patience, Goddess, and my favor,” he replied.
1131-“So you are a goddess!” Hermes said triumphantly, rising from the rubble unscathed.
1133-“He will keep your secret, or he will find himself in Tartarus.”
1134-Hermes brushed dirt and rock from his arms and chest. “You know, Hades, not everything has to be a threat. You could try asking once in a while—just like you could have asked me to step away from your goddess here instead of throwing me halfway across the Underworld.”
1135-“I’m not his goddess! And you—” Persephone looked at Hades.
1135-Hermes’s brows rose with amusement as she struggled to her feet, because up until now, she’d been glaring up at them both from the ground. “You could be nicer to him. He did save me from your river!”
1137-“You wouldn’t have had to be saved from my river if you had waited for me!”
1138-“Right, because you were otherwise engaged.” She rolled her eyes. “Wonder what that means.”
1139-“Shall I get you a dictionary?”
1140-Hermes laughed, and Hades turned on him. “Why are you still here?”
1142-“What’s wrong?” he demanded.
1143-“I fell on the stairs. I think I…” She took a breath and winced. “I think I bruised my ribs.”
1145-“It’s okay,” she whispered. “I’m okay.”
1146-Then Hermes said, “She has a pretty nasty gash on her shoulder too.”
1148-“Where are we going?”
1149-“To my palace,” he said and teleported, leaving Hermes alone on the riverbank.
1152-“Are you well?” Hades asked.
1155-Hades kneeled on the ground before her, and she felt a little panicked, hands trembling. “What are you doing?”
1157-“Which side?” he asked.
1160-“Better?” His voice was low, a husky whisper that trailed over her skin.
1161-“Yes.”
1162-“Your shoulder is next,” he said, standing.
1164-“No,” he said. “It’s best if you don’t look.”
1166-“Wake, my darling.” Hades’s voice was like his touch—warm, luring.
1167-“Sorry,” she whispered.
1168-“Do not apologize,” he said and set to work cleaning the blood from her shoulder.
1169-“I can do this,” she said and started to rise, but Hades held her in place and met her gaze.
1170-“Allow me this,” he said.
1171-So he would know she wasn’t asleep, she asked questions. “Why are there dead people in your river?”
1172-“They are the souls who were not buried with coins,” he said.
1173-She opened one eye. “You still do that?”
1174-She decided she liked when he smiled. “No. Those dead are ancient.”
1175-“And what do they do? Besides drown the living.”
1176-“That’s all they do,” he replied matter-of-factly, and Persephone paled.
1178-“Change,” he said.
1179-“I…don’t have anything to change into.”
1180-“I have something.” He helped her to her feet, directed her behind a screen, and handed her a short, black satin robe.
1181-She looked at the piece of fabric and then at him. “I’m guessing this isn’t yours?”
1182-“The Underworld is prepared for all manner of guests.”
1183-“Thank you,” she said curtly. “But I don’t think I want to wear something one of your lovers has also worn.”
1184-She wished he would have told her there were no lovers, but instead he frowned and said, “It’s either this or nothing at all, Persephone.”
1185-“You wouldn’t.”
1186-“What? Undress you? Happily, and with far more enthusiasm than you realize, my lady.”
1187-She took the robe from him. “Fine.”
1189-“What now?” she asked.
1190-“You rest,” he said and lifted her into his arms.
1192-“Thank you,” she whispered and then noted the harsh set of his face.
1192-Frowning, she said, “You’re angry.”
1194-“Persephone,” she said.
1195-“What?” he asked.
1196-“I want to be called Persephone. Not ‘lady.’”
1197-“Rest,” she heard him say. “I will be here when you wake.”
1204-“How long have I been here?” she asked.
1205-“Hours,” he replied.
1206-Her eyes widened. “What time is it?”
1207-He shrugged. “Late.”
1208-“I have to go,” she said but didn’t move.
1209-“You have come all this way. Allow me to offer you a tour of my world.”
1212-“Are you well?” His voice was deep and rumbled through her.
1213-She nodded. “Better.”
1214-He drew his finger along her cheek, leaving a trail of heat. “Trust that I am devastated that you were hurt in my realm.”
1215-She swallowed and managed to say, “I’m okay.”
1216-His gentle eyes hardened. “It will never happen again. Come.”
1218-“Do you like it?” he asked.
1219-“It’s beautiful,” she answered, and she thought he looked pleased. “You created all of this?”
1220-He nodded only once. “The Underworld evolves just as the world above.”
1222-She turned on Hades, pulling her hand from his. “You bastard!”
1223-“Names, Persephone,” he warned.
1224-“Don’t you dare. This—this is beautiful!” It made her heart ache and was something she longed to create.
1225-“It is,” he agreed.
1226-“Why would you ask me to create life here?” She tried to keep her voice from sounding so despondent, but she couldn’t manage it, standing at the center of her dream manifested outside her head.
1228-“It is illusion,” he said. “If it is a garden you wish to create, then it will truly be the only life here.”
1232-“You may work here,” he said.
1233-“I still don’t understand,” Persephone said, and Hades looked at her. “Illusion or not, you have all of this beauty. Why demand this of me?”
1234-“If you do not wish to fulfill the terms of our contract, you have only to say so, Lady Persephone. I can have a suite prepared for you in less than an hour.”
1235-“We do not get along well enough to be housemates, Hades.” His brows rose, and she lifted her chin. “How often am I allowed to come here and work?”
1236-“As often as you want,” he said. “I know you are eager to complete your task.”
1239-“And…how shall I enter the Underworld?” she asked. “I’m assuming you don’t want me to return the way I came.”
1240-“Hmm.” He tilted his head thoughtfully to the side.
1244-His dark hair fell in waves well past his shoulders, creating a dark halo around his face. “Once you enter Nevernight, you have only to snap your fingers, and you will be brought here.”
1247-“Can’t you offer favor another way?” she snapped.
1248-He looked amused. “You didn’t seem to mind.”
1251-“I should go,” she said.
1253-“What are you doing?” she demanded.
1255-“Persephone.” Hades’s voice was a low rumble, and she met his gaze. “Never bring a mortal to my realm again, especially Adonis. Stay away from him.”
1256-She narrowed her eyes. “How do you know him?”
1257-“That is not relevant.”
1259-“I work with him, Hades,” she said. “Besides, you can’t give me orders.”
1260-“I’m not giving you orders,” he said. “I am asking.”
1261-“Asking implies there’s a choice.”
1263-“You have a choice,” he said. “But if you choose him, I will fetch you, and I might not let you leave the Underworld.”
1264-“You wouldn’t,” she said between her teeth.
1265-Hades chuckled, leaning in so that when he spoke, his breath caressed her lips. “Oh, darling. You don’t know what I’m capable of.”
1271-“Your lips are bruised,” Lexa observed.
1273-“Who did you kiss?”
1274-“Why do you think I kissed someone?” Persephone asked.
1275-“I don’t know that you kissed anyone. Maybe someone kissed you.”
1279-“I’m just guessing since you left the apartment at ten last night and didn’t come home until, like, five this morning.”
1280-“H…how did you know that?”
1281-Lexa smiled, but Persephone could tell her friend was a little hurt by her sneakiness. “I guess we both have secrets. I was up talking to Adonis. I heard you come in.”
1283-“Oh. You and Adonis are talking?”
1285-“It doesn’t mean anything,” Lexa said.
1288-“We were making plans for today and just…kept talking,” Lexa continued. “He’s so interesting.”
1289-“He’s interesting?” Persephone laughed. “You’re interesting. Fashionista. Witch. Tattoos. What more could a guy want?”
1291-“Did you know he was adopted? It’s why he became a journalist. He wants to find his biological parents.”
1293-“I can’t imagine what that’s like,” Lexa said absently. “To exist in the world without really knowing who you are.”
1311-“I have had success,” he’d said.
1316-When the clerk—an older man with wild, wispy hair and a long, white beard—came to the narcissus, he looked up at her and said, “We do not carry his symbol here.”
1317-“Why not?” she asked, more curious than anything.
1318-“My dear, few invoke the name of the King of the Dead, and when they do, they turn their heads.”
1319-“It sounds like you have no wish to exist happily in the Underworld,” she said.
1333-“Oh.”
1340-“Oh.” She glanced down at the ball. “You want to play fetch?”
1342-It was beautiful, but just as she moved to draw water, a hand clamped down on her shoulder and drew her back. “No!”
1344-“Do not draw water from the Lethe,” the goddess added.
1346-“You’re a goddess,” Persephone said, getting to her feet, and the woman smiled.
1347-“Hecate,” she said and bowed her head.
1348-In any case, Hecate was known as a protector of women and the oppressed—a nurturer in her own way, even though she preferred solitude. “I’m—”
1349-“Persephone,” she said, smiling. “I have been waiting to meet you.”
1350-“You have?”
1351-“Oh yes.” Hecate’s laugh seemed to make her glow. “Since you fell into the Styx and had Lord Hades in an uproar.”
1353-“I’m sorry I scared you, but as I am sure you’ve learned, the rivers of the Underworld are dangerous, even to a goddess,” Hecate explained. “The Lethe will steal your memories. Hades should have told you that. I will scold him later.”
1354-Persephone laughed at the thought of Hecate scolding Hades. “Can I watch?”
1355-“Oh, I would only think to reprimand him in front of you, my dear.”
1356-They smiled at each other, and Persephone said, “Um, but do you happen to know where I might find some water? I just planted a garden.”
1357-“Come,” Hecate said, and as she turned, she picked up the red ball and threw it.
1357-The three dogs took off through the grass. “I see you have met Hades’s dogs.”
1358-“They’re really his?”
1359-“Oh yes. He loves animals. He has the three dogs, Cerberus, Typhon, and Orthrus, and four horses, Orphnaeus, Aethon, Nycteus, and Alastor.”
1360-As she filled the container, Persephone asked, “Do you live here?”
1361-“I live in many places,” Hecate replied. “But this is my favorite.”
1362-“Really?”
1363-“Yes.” Hecate smiled and looked out at the landscape. “I enjoy it here. The souls and the lost, they are my loves, and Hades is kind enough to have given me a cottage.”
1364-“It’s far more beautiful than I expected,” Persephone admitted.
1365-“It is to all who come here.” Hecate smiled. “Let’s water your garden, shall we?”
1367-“Tell me, what are these plants?”
1368-“That one is anemone.” Persephone found herself blushing. “Hades wore one in his suit the night I met him.”
1372-“Asphodel! I love these!” Persephone exclaimed, recognizing the flowers mixed among the grass with their long stems and spikes of white flowers.
1373-“Yes, we’re close to Asphodel.” Hecate held out her hand to stop Persephone from moving too far forward.
1376-“Are they…celebrating something?” Persephone asked.
1377-Hecate smiled. “It is market day. Would you like to explore?”
1378-“Very much,” Persephone said.
1381-“You look puzzled,” Hecate commented.
1382-“I just… Where does all this stuff come from?” Persephone asked.
1383-“It is made by the souls.”
1384-“Why?” Persephone asked. “Do the dead need this stuff?”
1385-“I think you misunderstand what it means to be dead,” Hecate said. “Souls still have feeling and perception. It pleases them to live a familiar existence.”
1386-“Lady Hecate!” someone called in greeting.
1389-“We do not know the Goddess of Spring.”
1392-“She is the daughter of the Goddess of Harvest,” Hecate explained. “She will be spending time with us here in the Underworld.”
1397-“The crown suits you,” Hecate said.
1398-“They’re just flowers,” Persephone replied.
1399-“Accepting them from the souls means a lot.”
1404-Hecate marched forward, like she wasn’t even fazed by Hades’s physique. “You know they never behave for me after you spoil them.”
1405-“They grow lazy under your care, Hecate.” His eyes slid to Persephone. “I see you have met the Goddess of Spring.”
1406-“Yes, and she is quite lucky I did. How dare you not warn her to stay away from the Lethe!”
1407-Hades’s eyes widened, and Persephone tried not to smile at Hecate’s tone. “It seems I owe you an apology, Lady Persephone.”
1410-“I am being summoned,” she said.
1411-“Summoned?” Persephone echoed.
1412-Hecate smiled. “The judges are in need of my advice.”
1414-“My dear, call the next time you are in the Underworld,” she said in parting. “We’ll return to Asphodel.”
1415-“I would love that,” Persephone said.
1417-“Why would the judges need Hecate’s advice?” Persephone demanded.
1418-Hades cocked his head to the side, as if he were trying to decide whether he should tell her the truth. “Hecate is the Lady of Tartarus. And particularly good at deciding punishments for the wicked.”
1419-Persephone shivered. “Where is Tartarus?”
1420-“I would tell you if I thought you would use the knowledge to avoid it.”
1421-“You think I want to visit your torture chamber?”
1422-“I think you are curious,” he said. “And eager to prove I am as the world assumes—a deity to be feared.”
1423-“You’re afraid I’ll write about what I see.”
1424-He chuckled. “Fear is not the word, darling.”
1425-She rolled her eyes. “Of course, you fear nothing.”
1426-Hades responded by reaching to pluck a flower from her hair. “Did you enjoy Asphodel?”
1427-“I did.” She couldn’t help smiling.
1427-Everyone had been so kind. “Your souls… They seem so happy.”
1428-“You are surprised?”
1429-“Well, you aren’t exactly known for your kindness,” Persephone said and immediately regretted the harshness of her words.
1430-Hades’s jaw tightened. “I’m not known for my kindness to mortals. There is a difference.”
1431-“Is that why you play games with their lives?”
1432-His eyes narrowed, and she could feel the tension rise between them like the restless waters of the Styx. “I seem to recall advising that I would answer no more of your questions.”
1433-Persephone’s mouth fell open. “You can’t be serious.”
1434-“As the dead,” he said.
1435-“But…how will I get to know you?”
1436-That stupid smirk on his face returned. “You want to get to know me?”
1437-She averted her gaze, scowling. “I’m being forced to spend time here, right? Shouldn’t I get to know my jailer better?”
1438-“So dramatic,” he said, but he was quiet for a moment, considering.
1439-“Oh no,” Persephone said.
1440-Hades raised a brow. “What?”
1441-“I know that look.”
1442-He raised a curious brow. “What look?”
1443-“You get this…look. When you know what you want.” She felt ridiculous saying that out loud.
1444-“Do I?” He paused. “Can you guess what I want?”
1445-“I’m not a mind reader!”
1446-“Pity,” he said. “If you would like to ask questions, then I propose a game.”
1447-“No. I’m not falling for that again.”
1448-“No contract,” he said. “No favors owed, just questions answered—like you want.”
1449-She lifted her chin and narrowed her eyes. “Fine. But I get to pick the game.”
1450-Then he grinned. “Very well, Goddess.”
1453-“This game sounds horrible,” Hades complained, standing in the middle of his study—a beautiful room with floor to ceiling windows and a large obsidian fireplace.
1454-“You’re just mad because you haven’t played.”
1455-“It sounds simple enough. Rock beats scissors, scissors beats paper, and paper beats rock. How exactly does paper beat rock?”
1456-“Paper covers rock,” Persephone said.
1456-Hades frowned at her reasoning, and the goddess shrugged. “Why is an ace a wild card?”
1457-“Because it’s the rules.”
1458-“Well, it’s a rule that paper covers rock,” she said. “Ready?”
1460-“Rock, paper, scissors, shoot!” they said in unison.
1461-“Yes!” Persephone squealed. “Rock beats scissors!”
1462-She mimicked smashing Hades’s scissors with her fist—the god blinked. “Damn. I thought you’d choose paper.”
1463-“Why?”
1464-“Because you just sang paper’s praises.”
1465-“Only because you asked why paper covers rock. This isn’t poker, Hades. It’s not about deception.”
1466-He met her gaze, eyes burning. “Isn’t it?”
1467-She looked away, drawing in a breath before she asked, “You said you had successes before with your contracts. Tell me about them.”
1468-Hades moved to a bar cabinet across the room, poured his drink of choice—whiskey—and took a seat on his black leather sofa. “What is there to tell? I have offered many mortals the same contract over the years. In exchange for money, fame, love, they must give up their vice. Some mortals are stronger than others and conquer their habit.”
1469-“Conquering a disease is not about strength, Hades.”
1470-“No one said anything about disease.”
1471-“Addiction is a disease. It cannot be cured. It must be managed.”
1472-“It is managed,” he argued.
1473-“How? With more contracts?”
1474-“That is another question.”
1475-When she threw rock and he scissors, she didn’t celebrate but demanded, “How, Hades?”
1476-“I do not ask them to give everything up at once. It is a slow process.”
1477-They played again, and this time, Hades won. “What would you do?”
1478-She blinked. “What?”
1479-“What would you change? To help them?”
1480-Her mouth fell open a little at his question. “First, I wouldn’t allow a mortal to gamble their soul away. Second, if you’re going to request a bargain, challenge them to go to rehab if they’re an addict, and do one better—pay for it. If I had all the money you have, I’d spend it helping people.”
1481-He studied her a moment. “And if they relapsed?”
1482-“Then what?” she asked. “Life is hard out there, Hades, and sometimes living it is penance enough. Mortals need hope, not threats of punishment.”
1483-He laid her palm flat, his fingers brushing the bandage Hecate had helped her tie. “What happened?”
1484-She offered a breathy laugh. “It’s nothing compared to bruised ribs.”
1486-“Why does it bother you so much?” She wasn’t sure why she was whispering.
1490-The god withdrew his hand from her face and asked in an irritated voice, “Yes, Minthe?”
1491-“My lord, Charon has requested your presence in the throne room.”
1492-“Has he said why?”
1493-“He has caught an intruder.”
1494-Persephone looked at Hades. “An intruder? How? Would they not drown in the Styx?”
1495-“If Charon caught an intruder, it’s likely he attempted to sneak onto his ferry.” Hades stood and held out his hand. “Come. You will join me.”
1499-“You are a goddess. You will sit in a throne.” He guided her to be seated and only then released her hand.
1499-When he took his place upon his throne, Persephone thought for a moment that he might drop his glamour, but he didn’t. “Charon, to what do I owe the interruption?”
1500-“You’re Charon?” Persephone asked the man in white.
1501-Charon grinned, and Hades’s jaw tightened. “I am indeed, my lady.”
1502-“Please call me Persephone,” she said.
1503-“My lady will do,” Hades said sharply. “I am growing impatient, Charon.”
1504-Persephone got the sense Charon was amused by Hades’s mood. “My lord, a man named Orpheus was caught sneaking onto my ferry. He wishes for an audience with you.”
1505-“Show him in. I am eager to return to my conversation with Lady Persephone.”
1507-“Is he dangerous?” Persephone asked.
1509-“You can see to his soul. Is he dangerous?” she asked again.
1510-Finally, he said, “No.”
1511-“Then release him from those bindings.”
1512-As he climbed to his feet, he looked at Persephone. “Thank you, my lady.”
1513-“Why have you come to the Underworld?” Hades asked.
1514-“I have come for my wife.” Hades did not respond, and the man continued. “I wish to propose a contract—my soul in exchange for hers.”
1515-“I do not trade in souls, mortal,” the god answered.
1516-“My lord, please—”
1518-“Do not look upon her for aid, mortal. She cannot help you.”
1519-“Tell me of your wife.” She ignored Hades’s gaze and focused on Orpheus. “What was her name?”
1520-“Eurydice. She died a day after we were married.”
1521-“Why does it bother you so much?” She wasn’t sure why she was whispering.
1525-The god withdrew his hand from her face and asked in an irritated voice, “Yes, Minthe?”
1526-“My lord, Charon has requested your presence in the throne room.”
1527-“Has he said why?”
1528-“He has caught an intruder.”
1529-Persephone looked at Hades. “An intruder? How? Would they not drown in the Styx?”
1530-“If Charon caught an intruder, it’s likely he attempted to sneak onto his ferry.” Hades stood and held out his hand. “Come. You will join me.”
1534-“You are a goddess. You will sit in a throne.” He guided her to be seated and only then released her hand.
1534-When he took his place upon his throne, Persephone thought for a moment that he might drop his glamour, but he didn’t. “Charon, to what do I owe the interruption?”
1535-“You’re Charon?” Persephone asked the man in white.
1536-Charon grinned, and Hades’s jaw tightened. “I am indeed, my lady.”
1537-“Please call me Persephone,” she said.
1538-“My lady will do,” Hades said sharply. “I am growing impatient, Charon.”
1539-Persephone got the sense Charon was amused by Hades’s mood. “My lord, a man named Orpheus was caught sneaking onto my ferry. He wishes for an audience with you.”
1540-“Show him in. I am eager to return to my conversation with Lady Persephone.”
1542-“Is he dangerous?” Persephone asked.
1544-“You can see to his soul. Is he dangerous?” she asked again.
1545-Finally, he said, “No.”
1546-“Then release him from those bindings.”
1547-As he climbed to his feet, he looked at Persephone. “Thank you, my lady.”
1548-“Why have you come to the Underworld?” Hades asked.
1549-“I have come for my wife.” Hades did not respond, and the man continued. “I wish to propose a contract—my soul in exchange for hers.”
1550-“I do not trade in souls, mortal,” the god answered.
1551-“My lord, please—”
1553-“Do not look upon her for aid, mortal. She cannot help you.”
1554-“Tell me of your wife.” She ignored Hades’s gaze and focused on Orpheus. “What was her name?”
1555-“Eurydice. She died a day after we were married.”
1556-“I am sorry. How did she die?”
1557-“She just went to sleep and never woke up.” His voice broke.
1558-“You lost her so suddenly.” Persephone’s chest ached and her throat felt tight.
1559-“The Fates cut her life thread,” Hades said. “I cannot return her to the living, and I will not bargain to return souls.”
1561-“Lord Hades, please—” Orpheus choked. “I love her.”
1562-“You may have loved her, mortal, but you did not come here for her. You came for yourself.” Hades reclined in his throne. “I will not grant your request. Charon.”
1565-“You wish to tell me to make an exception.”
1566-“You wish to tell me why it’s not possible,” she countered.
1567-His lips twitched. “I cannot make an exception for one person, Persephone. Do you know how often I am petitioned to return souls from the Underworld?”
1568-She imagined often, but still. “You barely offered him a voice. They were only married for a day, Hades.”
1569-“Tragic,” he said.
1570-She glared at him. “Are you so heartless?”
1571-“They are not the first to have a sad love story, Persephone, nor will they be the last, I imagine.”
1572-“You’ve brought mortals back for less,” she said.
1573-Hades looked at her. “Love is a selfish reason to bring the dead back.”
1574-“And war isn’t?”
1575-Hades’s eyes darkened. “You speak of what you do not know, Goddess.”
1576-“Tell me how you picked sides, Hades,” she said.
1577-“I didn’t.”
1578-“Just like you didn’t offer Orpheus another option. Would it have been relinquishing your control to offer him even a glimpse of his wife, safe and happy in the Underworld?”
1579-“How dare you speak to Lord Hades—” Minthe began, but she stumbled when Persephone glared at her.
1580-“Enough.” Hades stood, and Persephone followed. “We are done here.”
1581-“Shall I show Persephone out?” Minthe asked.
1582-“You may call her Lady Persephone,” Hades said. “And no. We are not finished.”
1584-“It seems you have a lot of opinions on how I manage my realm.”
1585-“You showed him no compassion,” she said.
1585-He stared at her for a moment but said nothing, and she wondered what he was thinking. “Worse, you mocked the love he had for his wife.”
1586-“I questioned his love. I did not mock it.”
1587-“Who are you to question love?”
1588-“A god, Persephone.”
1589-She glared at him. “All of your power and you do nothing with it but hurt.” He flinched at that, and she continued, “How can you be so passionate and not believe in love?” “How can you be so passionate and not believe in love?”
1590-Hades offered a humorless laugh. “Because passion doesn’t need love, darling.”
1593-“You are a ruthless god,” she said and snapped her fingers, leaving Hades alone in his throne room.
1600-“Persephone, you’re here early.” Adonis cleared his throat and straightened.
1601-“Just hoping to get a head start. I have a lot to do,” she said and passed them, heading straight for her desk.
1602-Adonis followed. “How’d Nevernight go?”
1603-She froze for a moment. “What do you mean?”
1604-“Hades invited you to Nevernight before we left the interview. How did it go?”
1606-“It was fine.” She stowed her purse and opened her laptop.
1607-“I thought he might convince you not to write about him.”
1608-She hadn’t considered that Hades’s intention in inviting her on a tour of the Underworld might be a tactic to keep her from writing about him. “At this point, nothing could convince me not to write about him. Even Hades himself.”
1610-“You’re going to make a great journalist, Persephone.” He took a step back and pointed at her. “Don’t forget to send me the article. You know, when you’re finished.”
1611-“Right,” she said.
1638-“Persephone speaking.” Her heart was still racing, and she took a deep breath to calm herself.
1639-“Persephone, it’s Valerie. I think your mother is here?”
1641-“Need I remind you a condition of your time here was that you stay away from the gods? Especially Hades.” She still hadn’t figured out how her mother knew she was at Nevernight, but she assumed the Goddess of Harvest probably had a spy among those at Hades’s club.
1642-“I’ll be right up.” Persephone managed to keep her voice even.
1644-“My flower!” Demeter approached her with open arms, pulling Persephone into a hug.
1645-“Mother.” Persephone pushed away. “What are you doing here?”
1646-Demeter cocked her head to the side. “It’s Monday.”
1651-“There is a lovely café down the street,” Demeter continued, but Persephone sensed the tightness in her voice.
1651-She knew Persephone had forgotten, and she didn’t like it. “I thought we might try it today. What do you think?”
1653-“Mother, I’m…so sorry.” Those words felt like glass coming out of her mouth.
1653-They were a lie, of course—she wasn’t sorry for what she was about to say. “I’m really busy today. Can we reschedule.”
1654-Demeter blinked. “Reschedule?”
1657-“I’m so sorry, Mother,” Persephone said again.
1658-The Goddess of Harvest tightened her jaw and managed in a perfectly flat tone, “Another time, then.”
1661-“Wow, your mother is beautiful.” Valerie’s comment drew Persephone’s gaze.
1661-The girl had a dreamy look on her face. “It’s too bad you couldn’t go to lunch with her.”
1662-“Yeah,” Persephone said.
1664-“Adonis.” She slammed her laptop closed as she reached the desk. “What are you doing?”
1665-“Oh, hey, Persephone,” he said and smiled. “Just reading your article.”
1666-“It’s not finished.” She tried to remain calm, but it was hard when he’d just invaded her privacy.
1667-“I think it’s good,” he said. “You’ve really got something.”
1668-“Thanks, but I’d really appreciate it if you didn’t look at my computer, Adonis.”
1669-He sort of laughed. “I’m not going to steal your work, if that’s what you’re worried about.”
1670-“I told you I’d send the article when I was finished!”
1671-He put his hands up and stepped away from her desk. “Hey, calm down.”
1672-“Don’t tell me to calm down,” she said between her teeth.
1673-“I didn’t mean anything by it.”
1674-“I don’t really care what you meant,” she snapped.
1676-“Everything okay out here?” Demetri appeared at his door, and Persephone glared at Adonis.
1677-“Yeah, everything’s fine,” Adonis said.
1678-“Persephone?” Demetri looked at her expectantly.
1681-She took a deep breath before forcing the words out. “Yeah, everything’s fine.”
1687-He wore a scowl until he recognized her, and then a charming, yellow smile spread across his face as he reached for the door. “My lady—I mean, Persephone.”
1688-“Good evening, Mekonnen.” She grinned at the ogre as she passed into the club.
1696-“Hermes,” she said, relieved.
1697-“Sephy!” he exclaimed. “What are you wearing?”
1698-She knew perfectly well what she was wearing. “I just came from class.”
1699-“College chic.” He raised his golden brows. “Hot.”
1701-“What are you doing here?” Persephone asked.
1702-“Well, I am the Messenger of the Gods,” he said.
1703-“No, what are you doing here? On the floor of Nevernight?”
1704-“Gods gamble too, Sephy,” he answered.
1705-“Don’t call me that,” she said. “And why would gods gamble with Hades?”
1706-“For the thrill.” Hermes smiled mischievously.
1708-“Where are we going, Sephy?”
1709-She thought it was funny that he included himself in that statement. “I’m going to Hades’s office.”
1710-“He won’t be in there,” Hermes said, and it occurred to her that perhaps he didn’t know about her and Hades’s bargain.
1711-She looked at the god, and though she wasn’t here to see Hades, she still wondered aloud, “Then where is he?”
1712-Hermes grinned. “He is reviewing propositions for contracts across the way.”
1714-“I’m not here for Hades,” she said and hurried ahead to his office.
1716-“Should you be doing that?” she asked.
1717-The god shrugged. “Hades owes me, right? I saved your life.”
1718-Persephone looked away. “I owe you. Not Hades.”
1719-“Careful, Goddess. One bargain with a god is enough, don’t you think?”
1720-She startled. “You know?”
1721-Hermes smiled. “Sephy, I wasn’t born yesterday.”
1722-“You must think I’m incredibly stupid,” she said.
1723-“No. I think you were lured by Hades’s charms.”
1724-“So you agree Hades has wronged me?”
1725-“No,” he said. “I’m saying you’re attracted to him.”
1728-She resisted, but Hermes pressed his lips close to her ear and murmured, “Trust me. You’ll want to see this.”
1730-She started to ask if they could be seen, but Hermes pressed a finger to his lips. “Shh.”
1734-“You are wasting your time!” Minthe said.
1735-“It’s not like I’m running out,” Hades snapped, clearly not wanting to listen to the nymph lecture him.
1736-Minthe’s face hardened. “This is a club. Mortals bargain for their desires. They do not make requests of the God of the Underworld.”
1737-“This club is what I say it is.”
1738-Minthe glared at him. “You think this will sway the goddess to think better of you?”
1740-“I do not care what others think of me, and that includes you, Minthe.” Her face fell, and Hades continued, “I will hear her offer. “I will hear her offer.”
1743-“What are you doing here?” Persephone asked.
1744-“Well, I am the Messenger of the Gods,” he said.
1745-“No, what are you doing here? On the floor of Nevernight?”
1746-“Gods gamble too, Sephy,” he answered.
1747-“Don’t call me that,” she said. “And why would gods gamble with Hades?”
1748-“For the thrill.” Hermes smiled mischievously.
1750-“Where are we going, Sephy?”
1751-She thought it was funny that he included himself in that statement. “I’m going to Hades’s office.”
1752-“He won’t be in there,” Hermes said, and it occurred to her that perhaps he didn’t know about her and Hades’s bargain.
1753-She looked at the god, and though she wasn’t here to see Hades, she still wondered aloud, “Then where is he?”
1754-Hermes grinned. “He is reviewing propositions for contracts across the way.”
1756-“I’m not here for Hades,” she said and hurried ahead to his office.
1758-“Should you be doing that?” she asked.
1759-The god shrugged. “Hades owes me, right? I saved your life.”
1760-Persephone looked away. “I owe you. Not Hades.”
1761-“Careful, Goddess. One bargain with a god is enough, don’t you think?”
1762-She startled. “You know?”
1763-Hermes smiled. “Sephy, I wasn’t born yesterday.”
1764-“You must think I’m incredibly stupid,” she said.
1765-“No. I think you were lured by Hades’s charms.”
1766-“So you agree Hades has wronged me?”
1767-“No,” he said. “I’m saying you’re attracted to him.”
1770-She resisted, but Hermes pressed his lips close to her ear and murmured, “Trust me. You’ll want to see this.”
1772-She started to ask if they could be seen, but Hermes pressed a finger to his lips. “Shh.”
1776-“You are wasting your time!” Minthe said.
1777-“It’s not like I’m running out,” Hades snapped, clearly not wanting to listen to the nymph lecture him.
1778-Minthe’s face hardened. “This is a club. Mortals bargain for their desires. They do not make requests of the God of the Underworld.”
1779-“This club is what I say it is.”
1780-Minthe glared at him. “You think this will sway the goddess to think better of you?”
1782-“I do not care what others think of me, and that includes you, Minthe.” Her face fell, and Hades continued, “I will hear her offer. “I will hear her offer.”
1785-“You have nothing to fear,” Hades said in his warm, soothing baritone, and the mortal was able to move again.
1786-She offered a small, nervous laugh, and when she spoke, her voice was rough. “I told myself I wouldn’t hesitate. I wouldn’t let fear get the best of me.”
1787-Persephone knew that look—he was curious. “But you have been afraid. For a very long time.”
1788-She brushed at them fiercely, hands shaking, and offered that nervous laugh again. “I told myself I wouldn’t cry either.”
1789-“Why?”
1790-When the woman met the god’s gaze, she was serious, her face still glistening with tears. “The Divine are not moved by my pain.”
1792-“I suppose I cannot blame you,” the woman continued. “I am one in a million pleading for myself.”
1793-Again, Hades tilted his head. “But you are not pleading for yourself, are you?”
1794-The woman’s mouth quivered, and she answered in a whisper, “No.”
1795-“Tell me,” he coaxed.
1796-“My daughter.” The words were a sob. “She’s sick. Pineoblastoma. It’s an aggressive cancer. I wager my life for hers.”
1797-
1798-Hades studied the woman for a long moment. “My wagers are not for souls like you.”
1799-She would come out of this mirror and fight for that woman, but Hermes held on to her shoulder tight. “Wait.”
1801-“Please,” the woman whispered. “I will give you anything—whatever you want.”
1802-Hades dared to laugh. “You could not give me what I want.”
1803-The woman hung her head, and her shoulders shook as she sobbed into her hands. “You were my last hope. My last hope.”
1804-After he brushed her tears away, he said, “I will not enter into a contract with you because I do not wish to take from you. That does not mean I will not help you.”
1806-“Your daughter has my favor. She will be well and just as brave as her mother, I think.”
1807-“Oh, thank you! Thank you!” The woman threw her arms around Hades, and the god stiffened, clearly unsure of what to do.
1808-After a moment, he pulled her away and said, “Go. See to your daughter.”
1809-The woman took a few steps back. “You are the most generous god.”
1810-Hades offered a dark chuckle. “I will amend my previous statement. In exchange for my favor, you will tell no one I have aided you.”
1811-The woman looked surprised. “But—”
1813-“Thank you.” She turned to leave, practically racing out of the office. “Thank you!”
1816-“Rude,” the God of Trickery said.
1817-“I could say the same,” the God of the Dead replied, his eyes falling unfavorably to Persephone as she got to her feet. “Hear everything you wanted?”
1818-“I wanted to go to the Underworld, but someone revoked my favor.”
1819-Hades’s gaze turned to Hermes. “I have a job for you, messenger.”
1821-“Ass!”
1842-“Hmm.” Persephone was sure this map was missing vital parts of the Underworld—like Elysium and Tartarus.
1842-“Strange.” She reached into the basin.
1843-“Curiosity is a dangerous quality, my lady.”
1845-“I’m more than aware,” she snapped.
1845-“And don’t call me my lady.” Hades simply watched her, saying nothing, so Persephone added, “This map of your world is not complete. “This map of your world is not complete.”
1846-Hades glanced at the water. “What do you see?”
1847-“Your palace, Asphodel, the river Styx, and the Lethe… That’s it.” All places she’d been before. “Where is Elysium? Tartarus?”
1848-The corners of Hades mouth quirked. “The map will reveal them when you’ve earned the right to know.”
1849-“What do you mean earned?”
1850-“Only those I trust most may view this map in its entirety.”
1851-She straightened. “Who can see the whole map?” He just smirked, so she demanded, “Can Minthe see it?” “Can Minthe see it?”
1852-His eyes narrowed. “Would that bother you, Lady Persephone?”
1853-“No,” she lied.
1855-“Why did you revoke my favor?” she demanded.
1856-“To teach you a lesson,” he replied.
1857-“To not bring mortals into your realm?”
1858-“To not leave when you are angry with me,” he said.
1859-“Excuse me?” She halted and set the books on a nearby shelf.
1860-They were standing in the narrow stacks, and the smell of dust floated in the air around them. “You strike me as someone who has a lot of emotions and has never quite been taught how to deal with it all, but I can assure you, running away is not the solution.”
1861-“I had nothing more to say to you.”
1862-“It’s not about words,” he said. “I’d rather help you understand my motivations than have you spy on me.”
1863-“It was not my intention to spy,” she said. “Hermes—”
1864-“I know it was Hermes who pulled you into that mirror,” he said. “I do not wish for you to leave and be angry with me.”
1865-She should have taken his comment as endearing, but she couldn’t stop herself from sounding disgusted when she asked, “Why?”
1867-“Because,” he said and then thought for a moment.
1867-“It is important to me. I would rather explore your anger. I would hear your advice. I wish to understand your perspective.” She started to open her mouth and ask why again when he added, “Because you have lived among mortals. “Because you have lived among mortals. You understand them better than I. Because you are compassionate.”
1868-She swallowed. “Why did you help the mother tonight?”
1869-“Because I wished to.”
1870-“And Orpheus?”
1871-Hades sighed, rubbing his eyes with his forefinger and thumb. “It isn’t so simple. Yes, I have the ability to resurrect the dead, but it does not work with everyone, especially where the Fates are involved. Eurydice’s life was cut short by the Fates for a reason. I cannot touch her.”
1872-“But the girl?”
1873-“She wasn’t dead, just in limbo. I can bargain with the Fates for lives in limbo.”
1874-“What do you mean bargain with the Fates?”
1875-“It is a fragile thing,” he said. “If I ask the Fates to spare one soul, I do not get a say in the life of another.”
1876-“But…you are the God of the Underworld!”
1877-“And the Fates are Divine,” he said. “I must respect their existence as they respect mine.”
1878-“That doesn’t seem fair.”
1879-Hades raised a brow. “Doesn’t it? Or is it that it doesn’t sound fair to mortals?”
1880-It was exactly that. “So mortals have to suffer for the sake of your game?”
1881-Hades’s jaw tightened. “It is not a game, Persephone. Least of all mine.”
1882-His stern voice gave her pause, and she glared at him. “So you’ve offered an explanation for part of your behavior, but what of the other bargains?”
1883-Hades’s eyes darkened, and he took a step toward her in the already-restricted space. “Are you asking for yourself or the mortals you claim to defend?”
1884-“Claim?” She would show him—her arguments against his tricks were not for show.
1885-“You only became interested in my business ventures after you entered into a contract with me.”
1886-“Business ventures? Is that what you call willfully misleading me?”
1887-His brows rose. “So this is about you.”
1888-“What you have done is unjust—not just to me but to all the mortals—”
1889-“I do not want to talk about mortals. I would like to talk about you.” Hades moved toward her, and she took a step away, the bookcase pressing into her back. “Why did you invite me to your table?”
1890-Persephone looked away. “You said you’d teach me.”
1891-“Teach you what, Goddess?” He stared at her a moment, eyes seductive and dark.
1891-Then his head dropped into the crook of her neck and his lips brushed lightly over her skin. “What did you truly desire to learn then?”
1892-“Cards,” she whispered, but she could barely breathe, and she knew she was lying.
1893-He whispered words against her skin. “What else?”
1895-“Only those I trust most may view this map in its entirety.”
1896-She straightened. “Who can see the whole map?” He just smirked, so she demanded, “Can Minthe see it?” “Can Minthe see it?”
1897-His eyes narrowed. “Would that bother you, Lady Persephone?”
1898-“No,” she lied.
1900-“Why did you revoke my favor?” she demanded.
1901-“To teach you a lesson,” he replied.
1902-“To not bring mortals into your realm?”
1903-“To not leave when you are angry with me,” he said.
1904-“Excuse me?” She halted and set the books on a nearby shelf.
1905-They were standing in the narrow stacks, and the smell of dust floated in the air around them. “You strike me as someone who has a lot of emotions and has never quite been taught how to deal with it all, but I can assure you, running away is not the solution.”
1906-“I had nothing more to say to you.”
1907-“It’s not about words,” he said. “I’d rather help you understand my motivations than have you spy on me.”
1908-“It was not my intention to spy,” she said. “Hermes—”
1909-“I know it was Hermes who pulled you into that mirror,” he said. “I do not wish for you to leave and be angry with me.”
1910-She should have taken his comment as endearing, but she couldn’t stop herself from sounding disgusted when she asked, “Why?”
1912-“Because,” he said and then thought for a moment.
1912-“It is important to me. I would rather explore your anger. I would hear your advice. I wish to understand your perspective.” She started to open her mouth and ask why again when he added, “Because you have lived among mortals. “Because you have lived among mortals. You understand them better than I. Because you are compassionate.”
1913-She swallowed. “Why did you help the mother tonight?”
1914-“Because I wished to.”
1915-“And Orpheus?”
1916-Hades sighed, rubbing his eyes with his forefinger and thumb. “It isn’t so simple. Yes, I have the ability to resurrect the dead, but it does not work with everyone, especially where the Fates are involved. Eurydice’s life was cut short by the Fates for a reason. I cannot touch her.”
1917-“But the girl?”
1918-“She wasn’t dead, just in limbo. I can bargain with the Fates for lives in limbo.”
1919-“What do you mean bargain with the Fates?”
1920-“It is a fragile thing,” he said. “If I ask the Fates to spare one soul, I do not get a say in the life of another.”
1921-“But…you are the God of the Underworld!”
1922-“And the Fates are Divine,” he said. “I must respect their existence as they respect mine.”
1923-“That doesn’t seem fair.”
1924-Hades raised a brow. “Doesn’t it? Or is it that it doesn’t sound fair to mortals?”
1925-It was exactly that. “So mortals have to suffer for the sake of your game?”
1926-Hades’s jaw tightened. “It is not a game, Persephone. Least of all mine.”
1927-His stern voice gave her pause, and she glared at him. “So you’ve offered an explanation for part of your behavior, but what of the other bargains?”
1928-Hades’s eyes darkened, and he took a step toward her in the already-restricted space. “Are you asking for yourself or the mortals you claim to defend?”
1929-“Claim?” She would show him—her arguments against his tricks were not for show.
1930-“You only became interested in my business ventures after you entered into a contract with me.”
1931-“Business ventures? Is that what you call willfully misleading me?”
1932-His brows rose. “So this is about you.”
1933-“What you have done is unjust—not just to me but to all the mortals—”
1934-“I do not want to talk about mortals. I would like to talk about you.” Hades moved toward her, and she took a step away, the bookcase pressing into her back. “Why did you invite me to your table?”
1935-Persephone looked away. “You said you’d teach me.”
1936-“Teach you what, Goddess?” He stared at her a moment, eyes seductive and dark.
1936-Then his head dropped into the crook of her neck and his lips brushed lightly over her skin. “What did you truly desire to learn then?”
1937-“Cards,” she whispered, but she could barely breathe, and she knew she was lying.
1938-He whispered words against her skin. “What else?”
1941-“Tell me.”
1943-She thought he might claim her then, but when he didn’t, she took a deep breath, her chest rising against his, and said, “Just cards.”
1945-“You must wish to return home,” he said and started walking down the stacks.
1945-If she wasn’t talking to the God of the Dead, she would have thought he was embarrassed. “You may borrow those books if you wish.”
1946-She gathered them into her arms and quickly followed after him. “How? You withdrew my favor.”
1947-He turned to her, his gaze emotionless. “Trust me, Lady Persephone. If I stripped you of my favor, you would know.”
1948-“So I’m Lady Persephone again?”
1949-“You have always been Lady Persephone, whether you choose to embrace your blood or not.”
1950-“What is there to embrace?” she asked. “I’m an unknown god at best—and a minor one at that.”
1951-She hated the look of disappointment that shadowed his face. “If that is how you think of yourself, you will never know power.”
1953-“Don’t,” she commanded, and Hades paused. “You asked that I not leave when I’m angry, and I’m asking you not to send me away when you’re angry.”
1954-He dropped his hand. “I am not angry.”
1955-“Then why did you drop me in the Underworld earlier?” she asked. “Why send me away at all?”
1956-“I needed to speak with Hermes,” he said.
1957-“And you couldn’t say that?”
1959-“Don’t request things of me you cannot deliver yourself, Hades.”
1961-Instead, he nodded. “I will grant you that courtesy.”
1962-She took a breath, relieved. “Thank you.”
1963-He extended his hand. “Come. We can return to Nevernight together. I have…unfinished business there.”
1965-Persephone tilted her head back so she could meet his eyes. “How did you know we were in there? Hermes said we couldn’t be seen.”
1966-“I knew you were here because I could feel you.”
1967-On the way out the door, she paused. “You said the map is only visible to those you trust. What does it take to gain the trust of the God of the Dead?”
1968-He responded simply, “Time.”
1971-“Persephone!”
1975-But as she started to drift off, Lexa burst through her bedroom door. “Persephone! Wake up!”
1976-She groaned. “Go away!”
1977-“Oh no, you’re going to want to see this. Guess what’s in the news today!”
1979-“It’s all over social media today,” Lexa explained.
1980-“No, no, no,” Persephone gripped the tablet with both hands.
1982-She read the first line aloud. “Nevernight, an elite gambling club owned by Hades, God of the Dead, can be seen from anywhere in New Athens. The sleek pinnacle expertly mimics the imposing nature of the god himself and is a reminder to mortals that life is short—even shorter if you agree to gamble with the Lord of the Underworld.”
1984-“How did this get published?” she hissed.
1985-Lexa looked confused. “What do you mean? Didn’t you submit it?”
1986-“No.” She scrolled through the article, her stomach in knots.
1995-“Where are you going?” Lexa asked.
1996-“Work.” Persephone disappeared into her closet, trading her nightshirt for a simple green dress.
1997-“But…you don’t work today,” Lexa pointed out from her perch on Persephone’s bed.
1998-“I have to see if I can get ahead of this.” Persephone reappeared, hobbling on one foot to buckle her sandals.
1999-“Ahead of what?”
2000-“The article. Hades can’t see it.”
2001-“Persephone, I hate to break it to you, but Hades has already seen the article. He has people who look for this kind of stuff.” Persephone met Lexa’s gaze, and her friend winced. “Whoa.”
2002-“What?” Hysteria rose in Persephone’s voice.
2003-“Your eyes, they’re…freaky.”
2004-Avoiding Lexa’s gaze while her emotions ricocheted all over her body, Persephone reached for her purse. “Don’t worry about it. I’ll be back later.”
2009-“Persephone,” she said nervously. “I didn’t think you were in today.”
2010-“Hey, Valerie.” She tried to keep her voice cheerful and act like nothing was out of the ordinary—like Adonis hadn’t stolen her article and Lexa hadn’t woken her up to shove said angry article in her face. “Just coming in to take care of a few things.”
2011-“Oh, well, you have several messages. I, uh, transferred them to your voicemail.”
2012-“Thanks.”
2015-She tapped Adonis’s shoulder and he jumped, taking out an earbud. “Persephone! Congr—”
2016-“You stole my article,” she cut him off.
2017-“Stealing is a harsh term for what I did.” He pushed away from his desk. “I gave you all the credit.”
2018-“You think that matters?” she seethed. “It was my article, Adonis. Not only did you take it from me, you added to it. Why? I told you I would send it to you once I finished!”
2019-In all honesty, she wasn’t sure what she expected him to say, but it wasn’t the answer he gave. “I thought you would change your mind.”
2020-She stared at him a moment. “I told you I wanted to write about Hades.”
2021-“Not about that. I thought he might convince you he was justified in his contracts with mortals.”
2022-“Let me get this straight. You decided that I couldn’t think for myself, so you stole my work, altered it, and published it?”
2023-“It’s not like that. Hades is a god, Persephone—”
2024-Instead, she ground out, “You’re right. Hades is a god, and for that very reason, you didn’t want to write about him. You feared him, Adonis. Not me.”
2025-He cringed. “I didn’t mean—”
2026-“What you meant doesn’t matter,” she snapped.
2027-“Persephone?” Demetri called, and she and Adonis looked in the direction of their supervisor’s office. “A moment?”
2029-“Yes, Demetri?” she said from the doorway.
2030-He was sitting behind his desk, a fresh edition of the paper in hand. “Take a seat.”
2031-“you’re fired”? It was one thing to say you wanted the truth, another to actually publish it.
2033-Just as Demetri started to speak, Persephone said, “I can explain.”
2034-“What is there to explain?” he asked. “It’s clear by your article what you were trying to do here.”
2035-“I was angry.”
2036-“You wanted to expose an injustice,” he said.
2037-“Yes, but there’s more. It’s not the whole story,” she said.
2038-“I hope it’s not,” Demetri said.
2039-“What?” Persephone straightened.
2040-“I’m asking you to write more.”
2041-The Goddess of Spring was quiet, and Demetri continued. “I want more. How soon can you have another article out?”
2042-“About Hades?”
2043-“Oh yes. You have only scratched the surface of this god.”
2044-“But I thought… Aren’t you…afraid of him?”
2045-Demetri laid the paper down and leveled his gaze with hers. “Persephone, I told you from the beginning. We seek truth here at New Athens News, and no one knows the truth of the King of the Underworld. You can help the world understand him.”
2047-“Those who fear Hades are also curious. They will want more, and you’re going to deliver.”
2048-Demetri stood and walked to the wall of windows, his hands behind his back. “How about a biweekly feature?”
2049-“That’s a lot, Demetri. I’m still in school,” she reminded him.
2050-“Monthly, then. What do you say to…five, six articles?”
2051-“Do I have a choice?” she muttered, but Demetri still heard.
2052-The corner of his mouth quirked. “Don’t underestimate yourself, Persephone. Just think—if this is as successful as I think it will be, there will be a line of people waiting to hire you when you graduate.”
2055-“Your next article is due on the first,” he said. “Let’s have some variety. Don’t just talk about his bargains. What else does he do? What are his hobbies? What does the Underworld really look like?”
2065-“You’re Persephone, right?” one of them asked. “Is everything you wrote true?”
2066-She settled on “The story is evolving.”
2067-What she didn’t anticipate was the excitement in the girls’ eyes. “So there will be more?”
2068-Persephone cleared her throat. “Yeah…yes.”
2069-The girl on the left leaned farther over the table. “So you’ve met Hades?”
2070-“That’s a stupid question,” the other girl chided. “What she wants to know is what’s Hades like? Do you have pictures?”
2073-She offered a small, unamused smile. “I guess you’ll have to wait and see.”
2075-She guessed they were testing her name, and once they discovered she was Persephone, they ran up to her to ask the same questions—“Did you really meet Hades? What does he look like? Do you have a picture?”
2077-Grateful for the excuse to ignore more strangers, she answered it. “Hello?”
2078-“Adonis told me the good news! A series on Hades! Congrats! When do you interview him next and can I come?” Lexa laughed.
2079-“Th-thanks, Lex,” Persephone managed.
2080-“We should celebrate! La Rose this weekend?” Lexa asked.
2081-Everything was cream and pink, and like Hades’s Nevernight, there was an impossible waiting list. “How are we supposed to get into La Rose?”
2082-“I have my ways,” Lexa replied mischievously.
2083-“Hey, Lex. I’ll call you back.” Persephone hung up and acknowledged Demeter with a curt, “Mother. “Mother. What are you doing here?”
2084-“I had to ensure you were safe after that ridiculous article you wrote. What were you thinking?”
2085-Persephone felt the shock run deep, like an electrical current splicing through her chest. “I thought—I thought you’d be proud. You hate Hades.”
2086-“Proud? You thought I’d be proud?” Demeter scoffed.
2086-“You wrote a critical article on a god—but not just any god, Hades! You deliberately broke my rule—not once but multiple times.” Persephone’s surprise must have shown on her face because her mother added, “Oh yes. “Oh yes. I know you have returned to Nevernight on multiple occasions.”
2087-Persephone glared at Demeter. “How?”
2088-Demeter’s eyes fell to the phone in Persephone’s hand. “I tracked you.”
2089-“Through my phone?” Persephone knew her mother wasn’t above violating her privacy to keep tabs on her; she’d proven that by having her nymphs spy on her.
2089-She had no right to use it as a GPS. “Are you serious?”
2090-“I had to do something. You weren’t talking to me.”
2091-“Since when?” Persephone demanded. “I saw you Monday!”
2092-“And you canceled our lunch,” the goddess sniffed. “We hardly spend time together anymore.”
2093-“And you think stalking me will encourage me to spend more time with you?” Persephone demanded.
2094-Demeter laughed. “Oh, my flower, I cannot stalk you. I am your mother.”
2095-“I don’t have time for this.” She tried to sidestep her and leave, but she found she couldn’t move—her feet felt as though they were welded to the ground.
2096-“I have not dismissed you,” her mother said. “Remember, Persephone, you are only here by the grace of my magic.”
2097-It was what Demeter wanted so she could dole out her punishment, so instead, Persephone inhaled a shaky breath and whispered, “I’m sorry, Mother.”
2098-Then she felt her mother’s hold loosen around her shaking legs. “If you return to Nevernight again, see Hades ever again, I will take you from this world.”
2099-Persephone wasn’t sure where she gathered her courage, but she managed to look her mother in the eyes and say, “Don’t think for a second that I will ever forgive you if you send me back to that prison.”
2100-Demeter gave a sharp laugh. “My flower, I don’t require forgiveness.”
2112-“Five articles about the God of the Dead,” Lexa said dreamily. “What do you think you’ll write about next?”
2115-“You should write about his love life.”
2116-“What?” Persephone sputtered. “No. Absolutely not.”
2117-Lexa pouted. “Why not?”
2118-“Uh, what makes you think Hades would share that information with me?”
2119-“Persephone, you’re a journalist. Investigate!”
2120-“I’m not really interested in Hades’s past lovers.” Persephone stared out the window.
2121-“Past lovers? That makes it sound like he has a current lover…like you’re the current lover.”
2122-“Uh, no,” Persephone said. “I’m pretty sure the Lord of the Underworld is sleeping with his assistant.”
2123-“So write about that!” Lexa encouraged.
2124-“I’d rather not, Lexa. I work for New Athens News, not the Delphi Divine. I’m interested in truth.” Besides, she’d rather not learn whether that was true.
2125-“You’re pretty sure Hades is banging his assistant. Just get it confirmed, and it’s truth!”
2126-Persephone sighed, frustrated. “I don’t want to write about trivial things. I want to write about something that will change the world.”
2127-“And bashing Hades’s godly antics will change the world?”
2128-“It might,” Persephone argued, and Lexa shook her head. “What?”
2129-Her friend sighed. “It’s just…all you did in publishing that article was confirm everyone’s thoughts and fears about the God of the Dead. I’m guessing there are other truths about Hades that weren’t in that article.”
2130-“What’s your point?”
2131-“If you want your writing to change the world, write about the side of Hades that makes you blush.”
2132-Persephone’s face heated. “You’re such a romantic, Lexa.”
2133-“There you go again,” Lexa said. “Why can’t you just admit you find Hades attractive—”
2134-“I have admitted—”
2135-“And that you’re attracted to him?”
2137-“I don’t want to talk about this.”
2138-“What are you afraid of, Persephone?”
2140-“Persephone?”
2141-“I told you I don’t want to talk about it, Lexa,” she said tightly, hating the direction this conversation had gone.
2148-She was about to ask what he was doing here when Lexa called out to him. “Adonis!”
2149-She hugged him around the middle the moment he reached them, and he returned the embrace. “Hey, babe.”
2150-“Babe?” Persephone echoed flatly. “Lexa, what is he doing here?”
2151-Her best friend pulled away from Adonis. “Adonis wanted to celebrate you, so he reached out to me. We thought it would be fun to surprise you!”
2152-“Oh, I am surprised.” Persephone glared at Adonis.
2153-“Come on. I have a suite.” Adonis took Lexa’s hand and looped it through his arm, but when he offered the same to Persephone, she declined.
2158-“This is my personal suite,” Adonis said.
2159-“This is amazing.” Lexa went straight to the balcony overlooking the dance floor.
2160-“You like?” Adonis asked, hovering near the entrance.
2161-“Of course! You’d have to be crazy not to.”
2162-“What about you, Persephone?” Adonis looked at her expectantly.
2163-“You must be very lucky,” she said curtly. “You’re on the VIP list at two clubs owned by gods.”
2164-Adonis’s eyes dulled, but he didn’t miss a beat. “You should know I’m lucky, Persephone. I set your career in motion.”
2169-“A cab, please,” Persephone said, glancing at her friend. “Make it two.”
2171-“My, my, my, Adonis. Looks like favor has its perks.”
2174-“Don’t believe everything you hear, Sybil,” Adonis said.
2175-“You expect us to believe you get all these passes because you work for New Athens News?” asked Xerxes.
2177-“Persephone,” Aro said. “You work for the News. Do you get passes to popular clubs?”
2178-She hesitated. “No—”
2179-“Persephone here was invited to Nevernight by Hades himself.”
2181-“Keep denying it. I know a charmed one when I see one,” said Sybil.
2182-“And we all know you’re fucking Apollo, but we don’t say anything,” said Adonis.
2183-“Whoa, that was out of line, man,” said Aro, but Sybil raised her hand to silence her friend’s defense.
2184-“At least I’m honest about my favor,” she said.
2186-“Lexa, let’s dance.” She took her hand and led her out of the suite.
2187-“I’m okay, Persephone,” Lexa said quickly.
2188-“I’m sorry, Lex.”
2189-She was quiet a moment, nibbling on her lip. “Do you think Sybil is right?”
2190-The girl was an oracle, which meant she was probably more in tune with the truth than anyone in the party, but still, all Persephone could say was, “Maybe?”
2191-“Who do you think it is?”
2192-It could be anyone, but there were a few goddesses and gods who were notorious for taking mortal lovers—Aphrodite, Hera, and Apollo, just to name a few. “Don’t think about it. We came here to have fun, remember?”
2194-“Oh, we didn’t order—” Persephone started to say, but the waitress interrupted.
2195-“On the house,” she said and smiled.
2202-“Persephone?”
2204-“Are you okay?”
2205-“Have you seen Lexa?” Persephone asked.
2206-“No. Have you—”
2207-“I have to find Lexa.” She turned away from Sybil, heading back downstairs.
2208-“Whoa, whoa—wait.” Sybil stepped in front of her. “Persephone, how much have you had to drink?”
2209-“One glass,” she said.
2210-The girl shook her head, brows pinched together. “There’s no way you’ve just had one glass.”
2213-“Whoa, where you going, babe?”
2214-“Let me go, Adonis.” She tried to pull away, but he held her fast.
2215-“Shh, it’s alright. I’m your friend.”
2216-“If you were my friend—”
2217-“You’re going to have to get over that little article thing, babe.”
2218-“Don’t call me babe, and don’t tell me what to do.”
2219-“Has anyone ever told you you’re a handful?” he asked, and then his hold on her tightened, forcing their hips together.
2221-“I just want to talk,” he said.
2222-“No.”
2223-His playful smirk turned down, and his bright eyes darkened. “Fine. We don’t have to talk.”
2226-“Hades,” she breathed.
2228-“Are you well?” he asked.
2229-There were so many things wrong with this day and night. “Let’s go.”
2231-“Hades—” she started to warn him, but he seemed to know what she was thinking and answered before she could form the words.
2232-“They will not remember this.”
2234-“Lexa!” She turned back too fast, and her vision swam.
2235-“I will ensure she gets home safe,” Hades said.
2237-“Persephone?” Hades’s voice was low, and his breath brushed her lips.
2238-“Hmm?” she asked, her brows knitted together, and she squeezed her eyes shut tight.
2239-“What’s wrong?”
2240-“Dizzy,” she whispered.
2242-“You smell good.” She fisted his jacket, pressing as close to him as possible.
2245-As they pulled out on the road, she asked, “What are you doing here?”
2246-“You don’t listen to orders.”
2247-She laughed. “I don’t take orders from you, Hades.”
2248-He raised a brow. “Trust me, darling. I’m aware.”
2249-“I’m not yours and I’m not your darling.”
2250-“We’ve been through this, haven’t we? You are mine. I think you know that just as well as I do.”
2251-She folded her arms over her chest. “Have you ever thought that maybe you’re mine instead?”
2252-His lips twitched and his eyes fell to her wrist. “It is my mark upon your skin.”
2254-“Should I leave a mark?” she asked.
2255-“Careful, Goddess.” His words were a growl.
2256-She rolled her eyes. “Another order.”
2257-“A warning,” Hades said through gritted teeth, and then his hands clasped her bare thighs and she inhaled sharply at the feel of his skin against hers. “But we both know you don’t listen, even when it’s good for you.”
2258-“You think you know what’s good for me?” she asked, dangerously close to his lips. “You think you know what I need?”
2259-Hades laughed. “I don’t think, Goddess. I know. I could make you worship me.”
2261-“I just want to talk,” he said.
2262-“No.”
2263-His playful smirk turned down, and his bright eyes darkened. “Fine. We don’t have to talk.”
2266-“Hades,” she breathed.
2268-“Are you well?” he asked.
2269-There were so many things wrong with this day and night. “Let’s go.”
2271-“Hades—” she started to warn him, but he seemed to know what she was thinking and answered before she could form the words.
2272-“They will not remember this.”
2274-“Lexa!” She turned back too fast, and her vision swam.
2275-“I will ensure she gets home safe,” Hades said.
2277-“Persephone?” Hades’s voice was low, and his breath brushed her lips.
2278-“Hmm?” she asked, her brows knitted together, and she squeezed her eyes shut tight.
2279-“What’s wrong?”
2280-“Dizzy,” she whispered.
2282-“You smell good.” She fisted his jacket, pressing as close to him as possible.
2285-As they pulled out on the road, she asked, “What are you doing here?”
2286-“You don’t listen to orders.”
2287-She laughed. “I don’t take orders from you, Hades.”
2288-He raised a brow. “Trust me, darling. I’m aware.”
2289-“I’m not yours and I’m not your darling.”
2290-“We’ve been through this, haven’t we? You are mine. I think you know that just as well as I do.”
2291-She folded her arms over her chest. “Have you ever thought that maybe you’re mine instead?”
2292-His lips twitched and his eyes fell to her wrist. “It is my mark upon your skin.”
2294-“Should I leave a mark?” she asked.
2295-“Careful, Goddess.” His words were a growl.
2296-She rolled her eyes. “Another order.”
2297-“A warning,” Hades said through gritted teeth, and then his hands clasped her bare thighs and she inhaled sharply at the feel of his skin against hers. “But we both know you don’t listen, even when it’s good for you.”
2298-“You think you know what’s good for me?” she asked, dangerously close to his lips. “You think you know what I need?”
2299-Hades laughed. “I don’t think, Goddess. I know. I could make you worship me.”
2302-“You will worship me,” she said and rolled her hips against him.
2302-His hands dug into her skin, and she moved in, her cheek brushing his as she whispered. “And I won’t even have to order you.”
2303-He fixed her dress, then covered her with his own jacket. “Don’t make promises you can’t keep, Goddess.”
2304-He had rejected her. “You’re just afraid.”
2312-“Why am I naked?” Persephone asked.
2313-“Because you insisted on it,” he answered in a voice void of the barely restrained desire he’d exhibited in the limo.
2313-She didn’t have many memories from last night, but she was sure she’d never forget the press of Hades’s fingers into her thighs or the delicious friction that sent shock waves through her body. “You were very determined to seduce me.”
2314-Persephone blushed fiercely and averted her gaze. “Did we—”
2315-Why was he laughing? “No, Lady Persephone. Trust me, when we fuck, you’ll remember.”
2316-When? “Your arrogance is alarming.”
2317-His eyes flashed. “Is that a challenge?”
2318-“Just tell me what happened, Hades!” she demanded.
2319-“You were drugged at La Rose. You’re lucky you are immortal. Your body burned through the poison fast.”
2323-“Adonis,” Persephone said.
2323-Hades’s jaw tightened at hearing the mortal’s name. “What did you do to him?”
2324-Once he finished, he set the glass aside, not looking at her. “He is alive, but that is only because he was in his goddess’s territory.”
2325-“You knew!” Persephone pushed off the bed and stood, Hades’s silk sheets rustling around her.
2325-She felt as if she were standing bare before him. “Is that why you warned me to stay away from him?”
2326-“I assure you, there are more reasons to stay away from that mortal than the favor Aphrodite has bestowed upon him.”
2327-“Like what? You can’t expect me to understand if you don’t explain anything.” She’d taken a step toward him, even though some part of her knew it was dangerous.
2328-“I expect that you will trust me,” he said, standing.
2328-The blunt admission shocked her. “And if not me, then my power.”
2332-“I thought you were jealous!”
2334-“Don’t pretend you don’t get jealous, Hades. Adonis kissed me last night.”
2335-Hades slammed the glass down. “Keep reminding me, Goddess, and I’ll reduce him to ash.”
2336-“So you are jealous!” she accused.
2337-“Jealous?” He stalked toward her. “That…leech… touched you after you told him not to. I have sent souls to Tartarus for less.”
2339-“I’m…sorry.” She wasn’t sure what to say, but his distress seemed so great, she thought she might ease it with an apology.
2341-“Don’t you dare apologize.” He cupped her face. “Not for him. Never for him.” He studied her and whispered, “Why are you so d “Why are you so desperate to hate me?”
2342-“I don’t hate you,” she said quietly, and Hades stiffened, tearing away from her.
2343-“No? Shall I remind you? Hades, Lord of the Underworld, Rich One, and arguably the most hated god among mortals, exhibits a clear disregard for mortal life.”
2345-Hades’s jaw worked. “This is what you think of me?”
2346-She opened her mouth and closed it before deciding to explain. “I was angry—”
2347-“Oh, that is more than obvious.” Hades’s voice was sharp.
2348-“I didn’t know they would publish it!”
2349-“A scathing letter illustrating all of my faults? You didn’t think the media would publish it?”
2350-She glared at him. “I warned you.”
2352-“You warned me?” He set his gaze upon her, dark and angry. “You warned me about what, Goddess?”
2353-“I warned you that you would regret our contract.”
2354-“And I warned you not to write about me.” He stepped closer to her, and she didn’t back down, tilting her head to keep his gaze.
2355-“Perhaps in my next article, I’ll write about how bossy you are,” she said.
2356-“Next article?”
2357-“You didn’t know? I’ve been asked to write a series on you.”
2358-“No,” he said.
2359-“You can’t say no. You’re not in control here.”
2360-“And you think you are?”
2361-“I’ll write the articles, Hades, and the only way I’ll stop is if you let me out of this Gods-damned contract!”
2362-“You think to bargain with me, Goddess?” The heat coming off him was almost unbearable.
2362-She stuck out one hand, clutching the sheet to her body with the other. “You’ve forgotten one important thing, Lady Persephone. To bargain, you need to have something I want.”
2363-“You asked me if I believed what I wrote!” she argued. “You care!”
2364-“It’s called a bluff, darling.”
2365-“Bastard,” she hissed.
2366-She craved him. “Let me be clear—you bargained, and you lost. There is no way out of our contract unless you fulfill its terms. Otherwise, you remain here. With me.”
2367-“If you make me your prisoner, I will spend the rest of my life hating you.”
2368-“You already do.”
2369-She didn’t like that he thought that and kept saying it. “Do you really believe that?”
2370-He didn’t answer, just offered a mocking laugh, and then pressed a hot kiss to her mouth before tearing away viciously. “I will erase the memory of him from your skin.”
2375-“Well, you would probably enjoy fucking me, but you definitely don’t like me.”
2395-“What is that?” she demanded.
2396-Hecate smiled softly and scratched the creature behind its small ear. “This is Gale. She is a polecat.”
2397-“That is not a cat.”
2398-“Polecat.” Hecate laughed quietly. “She was once a human witch, but she was an idiot, so I turned her into a polecat.”
2400-“I like her better this way,” Hecate added, then looked up at Persephone. “But enough about Gale. What can I help you with, my dear?”
2402-“If you cannot give life, what can you do?” she asked.
2403-“Destroy it.”
2404-Hecate’s pretty brows furrowed over her dark eyes. “You have never grown anything at all?”
2406-“Show me.”
2407-“Hecate…I don’t think that’s—”
2408-“I’d like to see.”
2409-When she looked at Hecate, the goddess was staring at her hands. “I think that is why Hades challenged me to create life—because he knew it was impossible.”
2410-Hecate did not look so certain. “Hades does not challenge people with the impossible. He challenges them to embrace their potential.”
2411-“And what is my potential?”
2412-“To be the Goddess of Spring.” The polecat hopped off Hecate’s lap as she got to her feet, brushing off her skirts.
2412-Persephone expected the goddess to continue asking questions about her magic, but instead she said, “Gardening is not the only way to create life.”
2413-Persephone stared at her. “How else should I create life?”
2414-She could tell by the amused look on her face that she wasn’t going to like what Hecate had to say. “You could have a baby.”
2415-“What?”
2416-“Of course, to fulfill the contract, Hades would have to be the father,” she continued as if she hadn’t heard Persephone. “He would be furious if it were anyone else.”
2417-She decided she was going to ignore that comment. “I’m not having Hades’s child, Hecate.”
2418-“You asked for suggestions. I was merely trying to be a good friend.”
2419-“And you are—but I am not ready for children and Hades is not a god I would want as a father to them anyway.” Though she did feel a bit guilty for saying that last part out loud. “What am I going to do? Ugh, this is impossible!”
2420-“It is not as impossible as it seems, my dear. You are in the Underworld, after all.”
2421-“You do realize the Underworld is the realm of the dead, don’t you, Hecate?”
2422-“It is also a place for new beginnings,” she said. “Sometimes, the existence a soul leads here is the best life they’ve ever had. I’m sure you, of all the gods, understand that best.”
2424-“Living here is no different than living up there,” Hecate added. “You challenged Hades to help mortals lead a better existence. He has merely charged you with the same here in the Underworld.”
2429-“Persephone?”
2432-“Yes?” she asked.
2433-“Have a moment?”
2434-“Sure.” She saved what she was working on and closed her laptop, following Demetri into his office where she took a seat.
2435-Her boss leaned against his desk. “How’s that article coming along?”
2436-“Fine. It’s…fine.” If he was looking for a summary of what she planned to write, she didn’t have one.
2438-“‘God of the Game’ was our most popular story to date. Millions of views, thousands of comments and papers sold.”
2439-“You were right,” she said. “People are curious about Hades.”
2440-“Which is why I called you in,” he said.
2442-“I’ve got an assignment for you.”
2443-“An assignment?” she echoed.
2444-“I’ve been holding on to these.” He reached for an envelope on his desk and handed it to her. “I hadn’t decided who to send, but I had no doubt after the success of your article.”
2445-“What is it?” She was too nervous to open the envelope, but her boss just smiled.
2446-“Why don’t you open it?”
2449-“But…why me?” she demanded. “You should be going to this. You’re the editor in chief.”
2450-“I have another obligation that night.”
2451-“Bigger than the Olympian Gala?”
2452-Demetri smirked. “I have been many times, Persephone.”
2453-“I don’t understand. Hades doesn’t even go to the gala.” She’d watched live coverage of the event with Lexa and had never seen him enter with the other gods, and no one had ever snapped a photo of him.
2454-“Lord Hades doesn’t allow himself to be photographed, but he always attends.”
2455-“I can’t go,” she said after a long silence.
2456-Her boss leveled his gaze with hers. “Persephone, what are you so afraid of?”
2457-“I’m not…afraid.” Though she kind of was.
2459-“Consider it an opportunity for research and observation,” he said. “We always write about the Olympian Gala. You’ll just put the spotlight on Hades.”
2460-“You don’t understand—” she started.
2461-“Take the tickets, Persephone. Think it over—but don’t take too much time. You don’t have long to decide.”
2469-Her desk phone rang, and she picked up. “This is Persephone.”
2470-“Hades’s…assistant is here to see you?” Valerie said.
2471-It took Persephone a moment to respond. “Minthe?” What could Minthe possibly have to say to her?
2472-“Oh, Adonis is bringing her back,” Valerie added.
2474-“Hey, Persephone,” Adonis said, oblivious to her frustration. “You remember Minthe?”
2475-“How could I forget?” Persephone replied matter-of-factly.
2476-The nymph smiled. “I came to speak with you regarding the article you published about my employer.”
2477-“I’m afraid I don’t have time to meet with you today. Maybe some other time.”
2478-“I’m afraid I must demand an audience.”
2479-“If you have complaints about the article, you should speak with my supervisor.”
2480-“I’d rather voice my concerns with you.” Minthe’s eyes flashed, and Persephone knew it would take a force of nature—likely Hades—to remove this lady from the building.
2481-They stared at one another for a long moment, and Adonis cleared his throat. “Well, I’ll let you two work this out.”
2482-After a moment, Persephone asked, “Does Hades know you’re here?”
2483-“It is my job to advise Hades on matters that might harm his reputation and, when he will not listen to reason, act.”
2484-“Hades doesn’t care about his reputation.”
2485-“But I do. And you are threatening it.”
2486-“Because of my article?”
2487-“Because you exist,” she said.
2488-Persephone leveled her gaze. “Hades’s reputation preceded his knowledge of my existence. Don’t you think it’s a little absurd to blame me?”
2489-“I’m not talking about his bargains with mortals. I’m talking about his bargain with you.” Minthe spoke louder, and though Persephone knew what she was doing, the tactic worked; she wanted to shut her up. “Now, if you will so kindly give me the time I have requested.”
2490-“Right this way,” Persephone said through gritted teeth.
2492-“You seem to think you have Hades all figured out,” Minthe said, her eyes narrowed.
2493-Persephone stiffened. “And you disagree?”
2494-She smiled. “Well, I have known him for centuries.”
2495-“Lord Hades doesn’t allow himself to be photographed, but he always attends.”
2496-“I can’t go,” she said after a long silence.
2497-Her boss leveled his gaze with hers. “Persephone, what are you so afraid of?”
2498-“I’m not…afraid.” Though she kind of was.
2500-“Consider it an opportunity for research and observation,” he said. “We always write about the Olympian Gala. You’ll just put the spotlight on Hades.”
2501-“You don’t understand—” she started.
2502-“Take the tickets, Persephone. Think it over—but don’t take too much time. You don’t have long to decide.”
2510-Her desk phone rang, and she picked up. “This is Persephone.”
2511-“Hades’s…assistant is here to see you?” Valerie said.
2512-It took Persephone a moment to respond. “Minthe?” What could Minthe possibly have to say to her?
2513-“Oh, Adonis is bringing her back,” Valerie added.
2515-“Hey, Persephone,” Adonis said, oblivious to her frustration. “You remember Minthe?”
2516-“How could I forget?” Persephone replied matter-of-factly.
2517-The nymph smiled. “I came to speak with you regarding the article you published about my employer.”
2518-“I’m afraid I don’t have time to meet with you today. Maybe some other time.”
2519-“I’m afraid I must demand an audience.”
2520-“If you have complaints about the article, you should speak with my supervisor.”
2521-“I’d rather voice my concerns with you.” Minthe’s eyes flashed, and Persephone knew it would take a force of nature—likely Hades—to remove this lady from the building.
2522-They stared at one another for a long moment, and Adonis cleared his throat. “Well, I’ll let you two work this out.”
2523-After a moment, Persephone asked, “Does Hades know you’re here?”
2524-“It is my job to advise Hades on matters that might harm his reputation and, when he will not listen to reason, act.”
2525-“Hades doesn’t care about his reputation.”
2526-“But I do. And you are threatening it.”
2527-“Because of my article?”
2528-“Because you exist,” she said.
2529-Persephone leveled her gaze. “Hades’s reputation preceded his knowledge of my existence. Don’t you think it’s a little absurd to blame me?”
2530-“I’m not talking about his bargains with mortals. I’m talking about his bargain with you.” Minthe spoke louder, and though Persephone knew what she was doing, the tactic worked; she wanted to shut her up. “Now, if you will so kindly give me the time I have requested.”
2531-“Right this way,” Persephone said through gritted teeth.
2533-“You seem to think you have Hades all figured out,” Minthe said, her eyes narrowed.
2534-Persephone stiffened. “And you disagree?”
2535-She smiled. “Well, I have known him for centuries.”
2536-“I don’t think I need to know him for centuries to understand he has no grasp of the human condition. Nor does he understand how to help the world.” Although what he’d done for that mother was more than generous.
2537-“Hades will not kneel to your every whim,” Minthe said.
2538-“I don’t expect him to kneel,” Persephone said. “Though it would be a nice touch.”
2539-Minthe took a step forward and spat, “Arrogant girl!”
2540-Persephone stiffened and lowered her arms. “I am not a girl.”
2541-“Do you know what? I don’t know what such a powerful god sees in you. You are entitled and magicless and yet he continues to let you into our realm—”
2542-“Trust me, nymph. It’s not a choice.”
2543-“Isn’t it? Isn’t it a choice every time you let him put his hands on you? Every time he kisses you? I know Lord Hades, and if you asked him to stop, he would—but you don’t. You never do.”
2544-Persephone’s blush was fierce, but she managed, “I don’t want to discuss this with you.”
2545-“No? Then I will get to the point. You are making a mistake. Hades isn’t interested in love, nor is he made for it. Keep walking this path and you will get hurt.”
2546-“Are you threatening me?”
2547-“No, it’s the promise of falling in love with a god.”
2548-“I’m not falling for Hades,” Persephone argued.
2549-“Denial,” she said. “It’s the first stage of reluctant love. Don’t make this mistake, Persephone.”
2550-Swallowing, Persephone felt her glamour ripple. “Is this why you came to my work? To warn me against Hades?”
2551-“Yes,” Minthe said. “And now I have an offer to extend.”
2552-“I want nothing from you.” Persephone’s voice shook.
2553-“If you truly wish to be free of your contract, you will take my offer.”
2555-Minthe chuckled. “Hades has asked you to create life in the Underworld. There is a spring in the mountains where you will find the Well of Reincarnation. It will give life to anything—even your desolate garden.”
2556-Those books also described the Underworld as dead and desolate. “And why should I trust you?”
2557-“It has nothing to do with trust. You want to be free from your contract with Hades, and I want Hades to be free from you.”
2558-She wasn’t sure what compelled her to ask the question, but she found the words rolling off her tongue. “Do you love him?”
2559-“You think this has to do with love?” Minthe demanded. “How sweet. I’m protecting him. Hades loves nothing but a good bargain, and you, my young goddess, are the worst wager he’s ever made.”
2563-“You are the worst wager he’s ever made.”
2568-“Good evening, my lady!” Persephone turned to find Yuri, a pretty young woman with thick curls, approaching her on the road.
2569-“Yuri.” Persephone smiled and hugged the girl.
2570-“What would I do with money in the Underworld?” she’d asked.
2571-Persephone had only laughed and said, “I like hugs.”
2573-“Is…something happening today?” Persephone asked.
2574-Yuri smiled. “We are celebrating Lord Hades.”
2575-“Why?” She didn’t mean to sound so surprised, but she wasn’t feeling generous toward the God of the Dead these days. “Is it his birthday?”
2576-“Because he is our king and we wish to honor him.” There were several festivals celebrating gods above ground, but none of them celebrated the God of the Underworld. “We’ve been hopeful that he will soon have a queen.”
2577-Her first thought was who? And then why? What had given them the impression that they might have a queen? “A…what?”
2578-Yuri smiled. “Come now, Persephone. You aren’t so blind.”
2579-“I think I am.”
2580-“Lord Hades has never given a god so much freedom over his realm.”
2582-“What about Hecate? Hermes?” she argued.
2583-“Hecate is a creature of this world and Hermes is merely a messenger. You…you’re something more.”
2584-Persephone shook her head. “I’m no more than a game, Yuri.”
2586-Yuri reached into her basket and offered Persephone a pomegranate. “Even so, will you not stay? This celebration, it’s just as much for you as it is for Hades.”
2587-The shock of Yuri’s words went deep. “But I’m not… You can’t worship me.”
2588-“Why not? You are a goddess, you care for us, and you care for our King.”
2589-“I—” She wanted to argue that she didn’t care for Lord Hades, but the words wouldn’t come.
2591-“Lady Persephone! Lady Persephone!”
2593-“Isaac! Apologize to your—” Yuri paused, and she got the sense the souls in Asphodel had already started calling her by a title she didn’t own. “Apologize to Lady Persephone.”
2595-“Sorry, Lady Persephone. Will you play with us?” Isaac begged.
2596-“Lady Persephone is not dressed to play, Isaac,” Yuri said, and the boy frowned.
2597-“It’s perfectly alright, Yuri,” she said and reached to lift Isaac into her arms.
2599-“Of course I’ll play,” she said.
2603-“My dear, you are a mess.”
2604-The Goddess of Spring smiled. “It was an intense game of tag.”
2605-“I hope you won.”
2606-“I was a complete failure,” she said. “The children are far more adept.”
2607-She’d asked him once why he seemed to be preparing for battle, and the man replied, “Habit.”
2609-“My lady,” Ian said. “Asphodel has a gift for you.”
2611-“Will you wear our crown, Lady Persephone?”
2614-She looked into his eyes and answered, “I will gladly wear your crown, Ian.”
2615-When she moved toward Hecate for respite, the Goddess of Witchcraft said, “I think you could use some rest. And a bath.”
2616-Persephone laughed. “I think you’re right.”
2617-“They will celebrate all night long,” she added. “But you have made their night. Hades has never visited to celebrate with them.”
2618-Persephone’s heart fell. “Why not?”
2619-Hecate shrugged. “I cannot speak for him, but it is a question you may ask.”
2620-The goddess considered her question, then asked, “Do you have a mask?”
2621-Persephone frowned. “I planned to pick one up tomorrow.”
2622-“Leave it to me.”
2625-“This is a public bath?” Persephone asked.
2626-Hecate laughed. “Yes, though Lord Hades has his own private pool. That is where you will bathe.”
2629-“Call for me if you need anything,” Hecate said and left Persephone to undress in private. “When you are finished, join us in the dining room.”
2636-Hades bent and picked it up. “This is beautiful.”
2637-“It is. Ian made it for me.” She didn’t bother asking him if he knew Ian.
2638-“He is a talented craftsman. It is what led to his death.”
2639-Persephone frowned. “What do you mean?”
2640-“He was favored by Artemis, and she blessed him with the ability to create weapons that ensured their bearer could not be defeated in battle. He was killed for it.”
2642-When he rose to his feet, Persephone was still staring at him and hadn’t moved an inch. “Why didn’t you go? To the celebration in Asphodel. It was for you.”
2643-“And you,” he said.
2645-“They celebrated you,” he said. “As they should.”
2646-“I am not their queen.”
2647-“And I am not worthy of their celebration.”
2648-How could this confident and powerful god feel unworthy of his people’s celebration? “If they feel you’re worthy of celebration, don’t you think that’s enough?”
2650-“May I join you?” His voice was deep and sultry.
2655-He stopped a few inches from her. “I believe I owe you an apology.”
2656-“For what, specifically?” she asked.
2658-The King of the Underworld reached out and touched her face, drawing a finger across her cheek. “Last time we saw each other, I was unfair to you.”
2659-She didn’t want him to see any of that in her eyes, so she looked away. “We were unfair to each other.”
2660-When she managed to look at him again, he was studying her. “You like your life in the mortal realm?”
2661-“Yes.” At his question, she put distance between them, swimming backward, but Hades followed, slow and calculated.
2661-“I like my life. I have an apartment and friends and an internship. I’m going to graduate from university soon.” And she would get to stay if she kept Hades and the contract a secret.
2662-“But you are Divine.”
2663-“I have never lived that way and you know it.”
2664-Then, “You have no desire to understand what it is to be a goddess?”
2665-“No,” she lied.
2666-“I think you’re lying,” he said.
2667-“You don’t know me.” She stopped moving and glared at him, angry that he saw right through her.
2668-“I know you.” He trailed his fingers over her collarbone and moved so that he was behind her. “I know the way your breath hitches when I touch you. I know how your skin flushes when you’re thinking about me. I know there is something beneath this pretty facade.”
2670-“There is rage. There is passion. There is darkness.”
2672-“And I want to taste it.”
2674-“Hades,” she breathed.
2675-“Let me show you what it is to hold power in your hands,” he said. “Let me coax the darkness from you—I will help you shape it.”
2678-“Hades, I’ve never—”
2679-“Let me be your first,” he said—begged—and his voice rumbled in her chest.
2682-“Breathe,” he said.
2684-“You’re so wet.” His mouth was warm against her skin.
2686-“Touch yourself. Here,” he said.
2689-He pulled away, resting his forehead against hers. “Do you trust me?”
2690-“Yes,” she breathed—and she felt the truth of her words deep in her soul.
2692-“Tell me you have never been naked with a man,” he said. “Tell me I am the only one.”
2693-She cupped his face, searching his eyes, and answered, “You are.”
2695-He looked up at her. “Was this me?”
2696-“It’s okay,” she whispered and ran her fingers through his hair.
2700-Hades pulled away from the kiss, wordlessly asking for permission, and she would have granted it had she not heard a soft, feminine voice call out, “Lord Hades?”
2702-“Ha—”
2704-“Yes, Minthe?” Hades’s voice was tight.
2705-“We…missed you at dinner,” Minthe said. “But I see that you are busy.”
2707-“Very,” he gritted out.
2708-“I will let the cook know you have been thoroughly sated.”
2710-“Quite,” he gritted out.
2713-“Where are you going?” he demanded, following after her.
2714-“How often does Minthe come to you in the bath?” she asked as she stepped out of the pool.
2715-“Persephone.”
2717-“Look at me, Persephone.”
2720-“Minthe is my assistant.”
2721-“Then she can assist you with your need,” she said, looking right at his cock.
2722-“I don’t want Minthe,” he growled.
2723-“I don’t want you.”
2724-Hades tilted his head to the side, and his eyes flashed. “You don’t…want me?”
2725-“No,” she said, but it was as if she was trying to convince herself, especially since Hades’s eyes had dropped to her lips.
2726-“Do you know all of my powers, Persephone?” he asked, finally leveling his gaze with hers.
2727-It was really hard to think when he was so close, and she looked at him warily, wondering what he was getting at. “Some of them.”
2728-“Enlighten me.”
2729-She recalled the passage she’d read about the Lord of the Dead’s magic. “Illusion.”
2730-As she spoke, he leaned in, lightly kissing the column of her neck. “Yes.”
2731-“Invisibility?”
2732-A press of his tongue in the hollow of her throat. “Very valuable.”
2733-“Charm?” she breathed.
2734-“Hmm.” The hum of his words vibrated against her skin, lower this time, closer to her breast. “But it doesn’t work on you, does it?”
2735-“No.” She swallowed hard.
2736-“You seem to not have heard of one of my most valuable talents.” He pulled the towel down, exposing her breasts, and took one tight bud between his teeth, sucking until a guttural sound escaped her mouth.
2736-He pulled back and leveled his gaze with hers. “I can taste lies, Persephone. And yours are as sweet as your skin.”
2737-“This was a mistake.” That part, she believed.
2738-“You might believe this was a mistake,” he said, and she paused but didn’t turn to look at him. “But you want me. I was inside you. I tasted you. That is a truth you will never escape.”
2746-“This is ridiculous,” she said aloud and got to her feet.
2752-“Tell me you’re thinking about me.” His voice came from the shadows—a chill breeze against a bright flame.
2754-When she said nothing, he prompted, “Well?”
2756-“Yes,” she breathed. “I was thinking about you.”
2757-Hades spoke in a growl that made Persephone’s skin prick. “Don’t stop on my account.”
2759-“Come for me,” he urged and then commanded again. “Come, my darling.”
2765-“Hades?” She whispered his name, feeling both ridiculous and nervous at the same time.
2769-“You look like a goddess,” Lexa said.
2771-Persephone blushed. “Thank you.”
2772-She added, “Like…the Goddess of the Underworld.”
2773-Persephone remembered Yuri’s words and the soul’s hope that Hades would soon have a queen. “There is no Goddess of the Underworld.”
2774-“The spot’s just vacant,” Lexa said.
2777-Persephone shook her head, clearing those thoughts away. “How’s Jaison?”
2779-Lexa blushed. “I really like him.”
2780-Persephone grinned. “You deserve it, Lex.”
2781-“Thank you.”
2783-“I’ll get it!” she called to Lexa.
2788-“Is that from Hades?” Lexa asked, stepping into the kitchen.
2789-“Well?” she prompted when Persephone didn’t answer.
2790-“Oh.” She looked down at the mask. “No, it’s not from Hades.”
2796-“Persephone, look.” Lexa elbowed her, and she tilted her head back to study the beautiful chandelier at the center of the room.
2798-“Persephone, the gods are coming! Come on!” Lexa took Persephone’s hand, dragging her across the floor and to a set of stairs that led to the second floor.
2799-“Lexa, where are we going?” Persephone asked as they headed to the stairs.
2800-“To watch the gods arrive!” Lexa said, as if that were obvious.
2801-“But…won’t we see them inside?”
2802-“Not the point! I’ve watched this part on television for years. I want to see it in person tonight.”
2804-“Look! There’s Ares!” Lexa squealed, but Persephone’s stomach turned.
2810-“Sybil!” she and Lexa called happily, but the beautiful blond couldn’t hear them over the cries of the crowd.
2813-Lexa leaned in and whispered to Persephone, “Something must be wrong. Demeter always works the red carpet.”
2818-Lexa leaned in and whispered, “Rumor has it Hephaestus didn’t want her.”
2819-Persephone snorted. “You can’t believe everything you hear, Lexa.”
2825-“Weren’t they all magnificent?” Lexa asked as she and Persephone headed inside.
2829-“Persephone?” Lexa asked when she didn’t move.
2834-She downed the remainder of her wine and then looked at Lexa. “Let’s find another drink.”
2836-“Can you hold this?” Lexa asked. “I need the restroom.”
2838-“Well, well, well, what do we have here?” She turned to find Hermes approaching through the crowd. “A Goddess of Tartarus.”
2840-“Get it? Torture?” She gave him a blank stare, and he frowned. “Because you’re torturing Hades?”
2842-“Oh, come on! Why else would you wear that dress?”
2843-“For myself,” she answered a little defensively.
2845-The God of Trickery lifted a brow, smirked, and conceded, “Fair. Still, the whole room noticed you were eye-fucking Hades.”
2846-“I was not—” She clamped her mouth shut, her cheeks reddening.
2847-“Don’t worry. Everyone noticed him eye-fucking you too.”
2848-Persephone rolled her eyes. “Did they also notice Minthe on his arm?”
2849-Hermes’s smile became wicked. “Someone’s jealous.”
2850-She was jealous, so she admitted, “I am.”
2851-“Hades isn’t interested in Minthe.”
2852-“It sure doesn’t look that way,” she muttered.
2853-“Trust me. Hades cares for her, but if he was interested, he would have made her his queen a long time ago.”
2854-“What’s that supposed to mean?”
2855-Hermes shrugged. “That if he loved her, he would have married her.”
2856-Persephone scoffed. “That doesn’t sound like Hades. He doesn’t believe in love.”
2857-“Well, who am I to say? I have only known Hades for centuries, and you—a few months.”
2860-Hermes nudged her with his shoulder. “Don’t worry, love. When you’re jealous, just make a point to remind Hades of what he’s missing.”
2861-The move surprised her, and Hermes laughed, calling back as he flounced away, his white wings dragging the ground like a regal cape, “Save a dance for me!”
2862-Lexa returned just then, looking bewildered. “Um, did Hermes just kiss you on the cheek?”
2863-Persephone cleared her throat. “Yeah.”
2864-“Do you know him?”
2865-“I met him at Nevernight.”
2866-“And you didn’t tell me?”
2867-Persephone frowned. “I’m sorry. I just didn’t think about it.”
2868-Lexa’s eyes softened. “It’s okay. I know things have been insane recently.”
2873-“Lord Hades is honored to reveal this year’s charity—the Halcyon Project,” she announced.
2878-“Days ago, an article was published in New Athens News. It was a scathing critique of my performance as a god, but among those angry words were suggestions on how I could be better. I don’t imagine the woman who wrote it expected me to take those ideas to heart, but in spending time with her, I started to see things her way.” He paused to chuckle under his breath, as if recalling something they’d shared, and Persephone shivered. “I’ve never met anyone who was so passionate about how I was wrong, so I took her advice and initiated the Halcyon Project. As you move through the exhibit, it is my hope that Halcyon will serve as a flame in the dark for the lost.”
2882-“I know what you’re thinking,” Persephone said.
2883-Lexa arched a brow. “And what am I thinking?”
2884-“He didn’t do this for me. He did this for his reputation.”
2885-“Keep telling yourself that.” Lexa grinned. “I think he’s besotted.”
2886-“Besotted? You’ve been reading too many romance novels.”
2892-“Persephone.” She smiled, and they hugged. “You look beautiful.”
2893-“So do you.”
2894-“What do you think of the exhibit? Marvelous, isn’t it?”
2895-“It is.” She couldn’t deny, it was everything she’d imagined and more.
2896-“I knew great things would come of your union,” Sybil said.
2897-“Our…union?” Persephone echoed slowly.
2898-“You and Hades.”
2899-“Oh, we’re not together—”
2900-“Perhaps not yet. But your colors, they’re all tangled up. They have been since the night I met you.”
2901-“Colors?”
2902-“Your paths,” Sybil said. “You and Hades—it was destiny, woven by the Fates.”
2904-Sybil frowned. “Are you okay?”
2906-“I’m sorry. I…should not have told you. I thought you would be happy.”
2907-“I’m not…unhappy,” Persephone assured her. “I just…”
2909-“Will you excuse me?” She headed for the bathroom.
2911-“So you are Hades’s little muse?” The tone was rich, seductive—a voice that lured men and bewitched mortals.
2914-“I don’t know what you’re talking about,” Persephone said.
2915-“Oh, don’t play coy. I saw the way you looked at him. He has always been handsome. I used to tell him all he would have to do is show his face and his realm would fill with the willing and faithful.”
2916-“Excuse me.” She tried to step around Aphrodite, but the goddess stopped her.
2917-“But I am not finished speaking.”
2918-“You misunderstand. I don’t want to speak to you.”
2921-“Anything to critique, Lady Persephone?” His voice rumbled low in his throat like a heady spell.
2922-“No,” she whispered and looked to her right.
2922-She still couldn’t see him, even in her peripheral. “How long have you been planning the Halcyon Project?”
2923-“Not long.”
2924-“It will be beautiful.”
2926-“A touch of darkness.” His fingers tracked down her arm and threaded through hers. “Dance with me.”
2927-He never failed to take her breath away, but there was a gentleness to his face that made her heart hammer in her chest. “All right.”
2930-That was probably why she chose to fill the silence with her next comment. “You should be dancing with Minthe.”
2931-Hades’s lips thinned. “Would you prefer that I dance with her?”
2932-“She’s your date.”
2933-“Our…union?” Persephone echoed slowly.
2934-“You and Hades.”
2935-“Oh, we’re not together—”
2936-“Perhaps not yet. But your colors, they’re all tangled up. They have been since the night I met you.”
2937-“Colors?”
2938-“Your paths,” Sybil said. “You and Hades—it was destiny, woven by the Fates.”
2940-Sybil frowned. “Are you okay?”
2942-“I’m sorry. I…should not have told you. I thought you would be happy.”
2943-“I’m not…unhappy,” Persephone assured her. “I just…”
2945-“Will you excuse me?” She headed for the bathroom.
2947-“So you are Hades’s little muse?” The tone was rich, seductive—a voice that lured men and bewitched mortals.
2950-“I don’t know what you’re talking about,” Persephone said.
2951-“Oh, don’t play coy. I saw the way you looked at him. He has always been handsome. I used to tell him all he would have to do is show his face and his realm would fill with the willing and faithful.”
2952-“Excuse me.” She tried to step around Aphrodite, but the goddess stopped her.
2953-“But I am not finished speaking.”
2954-“You misunderstand. I don’t want to speak to you.”
2957-“Anything to critique, Lady Persephone?” His voice rumbled low in his throat like a heady spell.
2958-“No,” she whispered and looked to her right.
2958-She still couldn’t see him, even in her peripheral. “How long have you been planning the Halcyon Project?”
2959-“Not long.”
2960-“It will be beautiful.”
2962-“A touch of darkness.” His fingers tracked down her arm and threaded through hers. “Dance with me.”
2963-He never failed to take her breath away, but there was a gentleness to his face that made her heart hammer in her chest. “All right.”
2966-That was probably why she chose to fill the silence with her next comment. “You should be dancing with Minthe.”
2967-Hades’s lips thinned. “Would you prefer that I dance with her?”
2968-“She’s your date.”
2969-“She is not my date. She is my assistant, as I have told you.”
2970-“Your assistant doesn’t arrive on your arm to a gala.”
2971-His hold on her tightened, and she wondered if he was frustrated. “You are jealous.”
2972-“I’m not jealous,” she said—and she wasn’t anymore.
2972-He smirked at her denial, and she wanted to hit him. “I will not be used, Hades.”
2973-That wiped the smirk off his face. “When have I used you?”
2975-“Answer, Goddess.”
2976-“Have you slept with her?”
2978-He stopped dancing, and those who shared the floor with them did too, watching with obvious interest. “It sounds like you are requesting a game, Goddess.”
2979-“You want to play a game?” she scoffed, stepping away from him. “Now?”
2988-He lifted his gaze from his drink and asked, “Hungry? You barely ate at the gala.”
2989-Persephone narrowed her eyes. “You were watching me?”
2990-“Darling, don’t pretend you weren’t watching me. I know your gaze upon me like I know the weight of my horns.”
2991-Her cheeks colored. “No, I’m not hungry.”
2996-“The game?” Persephone asked.
2997-“Poker,” Hades replied.
2998-The air in the room grew thick and heavy, and she took a breath before asking, “The stakes?”
2999-Hades smiled. “My favorite part—tell me what you want.”
3000-Finally, she said, “If I win, you answer my questions.”
3001-“Deal.” When he finished shuffling the cards, he added, “If I win, I want your clothes. “If I win, I want your clothes.”
3002-“You want to undress me?” she asked.
3003-He chuckled. “Darling, that’s only the start of what I want to do to you.”
3004-She cleared her throat. “Is one win equal to a piece of clothing?”
3005-“Yes.” He eyed her dress, and it really wasn’t fair, because it was all she had on except for her jewels.
3006-“And…what about jewelry?” Persephone asked. “Do you consider that undressing?”
3007-He took a sip from his drink before answering. “That depends.”
3008-“On?”
3009-“I might decide I want to fuck you with that crown on.”
3010-She smirked. “No one said anything about fucking, Lord Hades.”
3011-“No? Pity.”
3012-She leaned over the table, and though she felt shaky inside, she managed in as steady a voice as possible, “I’ll accept your bargain.”
3013-His brows rose, eyes alight. “Confident in your ability to win?”
3014-“I’m not afraid of you, Hades.”
3018-“Cold?” he asked as he dealt the first hand.
3019-“Hot.” She cleared her throat.
3021-After a moment, he said, “I suppose I will take the necklace.”
3022-She reached to unclasp it, but he stopped her. “No, let me.”
3024-“Still hot?” he asked against her skin.
3025-“An inferno,” she breathed.
3026-“I could free you from this hell.” His lips trailed up the column of her neck and she swallowed hard.
3027-“We’re just getting started,” she answered.
3029-Persephone smiled when their cards were on the table and said, “I win.”
3030-Hades kept his gaze narrowed upon her. “Ask your question, Goddess. I am eager to play another hand.”
3031-She bet he was. “Have you slept with her?”
3032-Hades’s jaw tightened, and after what seemed like an eternity, he answered. “Once.”
3033-The word was like a stone, dropped right in the pit of her stomach. “How long ago?”
3034-“A very long time ago, Persephone.”
3036-She swallowed and looked away, surprised when he added, “Are you…angry?”
3037-“Yes,” she admitted. “But…I don’t know why exactly.”
3042-“Your power of invisibility,” she said. “Have you ever used it…to spy on me?”
3044-“No,” he answered.
3046-“And will you promise to never use invisibility to spy on me?”
3048-“I promise.”
3049-As he started to deal another hand, she asked another question. “Why do you let people think such horrible things about you?”
3050-He shuffled the cards, and for a moment, she thought he might not answer, but then he said, “I do not control what people think of me.”
3051-“But you do nothing to contradict what they say about you,” she argued.
3052-He raised a brow. “You think words have meaning?”
3054-“They are just that—words. Words are used to spin stories and craft lies, and occasionally they are strung together to tell the truth.”
3055-“If words hold no weight for you, what does?”
3058-“Action, Lady Persephone. Action holds weight for me.”
3062-“I have thought of you every night since you left me in the bath,” he said, spreading her legs wide, pressing in against her.
3062-“You left me desperate, swollen with need only for you,” he gritted out.
3062-For a moment, she thought he might leave her desperate in return, but then he said, “But I will be a generous lover.”
3063-She reached for him, wishing to tangle her fingers in his dark hair, but he grabbed her wrists and held them against her sides and spoke against her. “I said I would be a generous lover, not a kind one.”
3066-“What are you doing?” she demanded.
3067-He dared to laugh. “Patience, darling,”
3070-“Where are we going?” she asked, hands fisted into his shirt.
3071-“To my chambers,” he said.
3072-“And you can’t teleport?”
3073-“I’d prefer the whole palace know we aren’t meant to be disturbed.”
3078-“We don’t have to do this,” he said.
3079-She reached for the lapels of his jacket and helped him out of it. “I want you. Be my first. Be my everything.”
3081-His shoulders were bunched, his hands fisted, and his jaw clenched, and she knew he was doing everything in his power to maintain control. “You are beautiful, my darling.”
3082-For a moment, Hades’s eyes darkened, and then Persephone said, “Drop your glamour.”
3084-She shrugged a shoulder. “You want to fuck me with this crown. I want to fuck a god.”
3085-His smirk was devilish, and he answered, “As you wish.”
3088-“Eager for me, Goddess?” He kissed down her stomach and then her thighs.
3091-“Fuck.”
3093-Confused, she asked, “Did I do something wrong?”
3094-His laugh was dark, his voice husky, his eyes predatory. “No.”
3095-His hand gripped the back of her neck and he kissed her, his tongue reaching deep before he tore away and said, “Tell me you want me.”
3096-“I want you.” She was breathless and desperate.
3098-“Tell me you lied,” he said.
3099-“I thought words meant nothing.”
3101-“Your words matter,” he said. “Only yours.”
3103-“Do you want me to fuck you?” he asked.
3105-“Tell me,” he said. “You used words to tell me you didn’t want me. Now use words to say you do.”
3106-“I want you to fuck me,” she said.
3108-“Patience, darling. I had to wait for you.”
3109-“I’m sorry,” she said, her voice quiet, sincere—and then he filled her completely.
3111-“No, let me hear this,” he growled.
3113-“You left me desperate,” he said, pulling out until he was barely inside her.
3114-“I have thought about you every night since.”
3116-“And each time you said you didn’t want me, I tasted your lies.”
3118-“You are mine.”
3120-“Mine.”
3122-After a moment, he drew back, pressing kisses to her face—her eyes, her cheeks, her lips. “You are a test, Goddess. A trial offered to me by the Fates.”
3124-When Hades moved, she reached for him, “No. Don’t leave.”
3125-He chuckled, kissing her once more. “I will come back, my darling.”
3131-“Fuck.”
3133-Confused, she asked, “Did I do something wrong?”
3134-His laugh was dark, his voice husky, his eyes predatory. “No.”
3135-His hand gripped the back of her neck and he kissed her, his tongue reaching deep before he tore away and said, “Tell me you want me.”
3136-“I want you.” She was breathless and desperate.
3138-“Tell me you lied,” he said.
3139-“I thought words meant nothing.”
3141-“Your words matter,” he said. “Only yours.”
3143-“Do you want me to fuck you?” he asked.
3145-“Tell me,” he said. “You used words to tell me you didn’t want me. Now use words to say you do.”
3146-“I want you to fuck me,” she said.
3148-“Patience, darling. I had to wait for you.”
3149-“I’m sorry,” she said, her voice quiet, sincere—and then he filled her completely.
3151-“No, let me hear this,” he growled.
3153-“You left me desperate,” he said, pulling out until he was barely inside her.
3154-“I have thought about you every night since.”
3156-“And each time you said you didn’t want me, I tasted your lies.”
3158-“You are mine.”
3160-“Mine.”
3162-After a moment, he drew back, pressing kisses to her face—her eyes, her cheeks, her lips. “You are a test, Goddess. A trial offered to me by the Fates.”
3164-When Hades moved, she reached for him, “No. Don’t leave.”
3165-He chuckled, kissing her once more. “I will come back, my darling.”
3195-“Are you well?”
3197-“Persephone?” His voice took on a lustful tone, and when she met his gaze again, she knew he was restraining himself.
3198-“I’m well,” she said.
3199-She thought he would kiss her, but instead he asked, “You are not regretting our night together?”
3200-“No!” Her eyes lowered, and she repeated herself quietly. “No.”
3201-Hades’s thumb passed over her bottom lip. “I don’t think I could handle your regret.”
3206-It was far too dressy to wear around the Underworld, and she planned to stay a while. “Do you…have something I can wear?”
3207-Hades gave her an appraising look. “What you have on will be just fine.”
3208-She gave him a pointed look. “You’d rather I wander your palace naked? In front of Hermes and Charon—”
3209-“On second thought—” He disappeared and returned in an instant, carrying a length of fabric in a beautiful shade of green. “Will you allow me to dress you?”
3214-“You actually eat in here?” Persephone asked.
3215-Hades’s lips quirked. “Yes, but not often. I usually take my breakfast to go.”
3217-“My lord,” Minthe said. “You have a full schedule today.”
3218-“Clear the morning,” he said without looking at her.
3219-“It’s already eleven, my lord,” Minthe said tightly.
3220-Hades filled his plate and, when he finished, looked at Persephone. “Are you not hungry, darling?”
3222-“No,” she said. “I…usually only drink coffee for breakfast.”
3223-He stared at her for a moment, and then, with a flick of his wrist, a steaming cup of coffee appeared before her. “Cream? Sugar?”
3224-“Cream.” She smiled, and when it was given, she cupped her hands around the mug. “Thank you.”
3225-“What are your plans today?” Hades asked.
3226-It took Persephone a moment to realize he was talking to her. “Oh, I need to write—”
3228-“Your article?” Hades finished.
3229-“I will be along shortly, Minthe,” Hades said at length, and Persephone’s heart fell. “Leave us.”
3230-“As you wish, my lord.” There was a note of amusement to Minthe’s voice that Persephone hated.
3231-When they were alone, Hades asked, “So you will continue to write about my faults?”
3232-“I don’t know what I’m going to write this time,” she said. “I…”
3233-“You what?”
3234-“Persephone?” His voice took on a lustful tone, and when she met his gaze again, she knew he was restraining himself.
3235-“I’m well,” she said.
3236-She thought he would kiss her, but instead he asked, “You are not regretting our night together?”
3237-“No!” Her eyes lowered, and she repeated herself quietly. “No.”
3238-Hades’s thumb passed over her bottom lip. “I don’t think I could handle your regret.”
3243-It was far too dressy to wear around the Underworld, and she planned to stay a while. “Do you…have something I can wear?”
3244-Hades gave her an appraising look. “What you have on will be just fine.”
3245-She gave him a pointed look. “You’d rather I wander your palace naked? In front of Hermes and Charon—”
3246-“On second thought—” He disappeared and returned in an instant, carrying a length of fabric in a beautiful shade of green. “Will you allow me to dress you?”
3251-“You actually eat in here?” Persephone asked.
3252-Hades’s lips quirked. “Yes, but not often. I usually take my breakfast to go.”
3254-“My lord,” Minthe said. “You have a full schedule today.”
3255-“Clear the morning,” he said without looking at her.
3256-“It’s already eleven, my lord,” Minthe said tightly.
3257-Hades filled his plate and, when he finished, looked at Persephone. “Are you not hungry, darling?”
3259-“No,” she said. “I…usually only drink coffee for breakfast.”
3260-He stared at her for a moment, and then, with a flick of his wrist, a steaming cup of coffee appeared before her. “Cream? Sugar?”
3261-“Cream.” She smiled, and when it was given, she cupped her hands around the mug. “Thank you.”
3262-“What are your plans today?” Hades asked.
3263-It took Persephone a moment to realize he was talking to her. “Oh, I need to write—”
3265-“Your article?” Hades finished.
3266-“I will be along shortly, Minthe,” Hades said at length, and Persephone’s heart fell. “Leave us.”
3267-“As you wish, my lord.” There was a note of amusement to Minthe’s voice that Persephone hated.
3268-When they were alone, Hades asked, “So you will continue to write about my faults?”
3269-“I don’t know what I’m going to write this time,” she said. “I…”
3270-“You what?”
3271-“I hoped I might be able to interview a few of your souls.”
3272-“The ones on your list?”
3273-“I don’t want to write about the Olympian Gala or the Halcyon Project,” she explained. “All the other newspapers will jump on those stories.”
3274-Persephone followed. “I thought we agreed we wouldn’t leave each other when we’re angry? Didn’t you request that we work through it?”
3275-Hades twisted toward her. “It’s just that I’m not particularly excited that my lover is continuing to write about my life.”
3276-She thought about correcting him but decided against it. “It’s my assignment. I can’t just stop.”
3277-“It wouldn’t have been your assignment if you had heeded my request.”
3278-Persephone crossed her arms over her chest. “You never request anything, Hades. Everything is an order. You ordered me not to write about you. You said there would be consequences.”
3279-It made her heart flutter. “And yet you went through with it anyway.”
3281-“I should have expected it,” he said, drawing his finger along her jaw, tipping her head back. “You are defiant and angry with me.”
3282-“I’m not…” she started to say, but then Hades’s hands cupped her face.
3283-“Shall I remind you that I can taste lies, darling?” He brushed her bottom lip with his thumb. “I could spend all day kissing you.”
3284-“No one’s stopping you,” she said, surprised by the words that came out of her mouth.
3288-He held her hand, fingers laced, and called a name into the air. “Thanatos!”
3290-“My lord, my lady.” Thanatos bowed to them.
3291-“Thanatos, Lady Persephone has a list of souls she’d like to meet. Would you mind escorting her?”
3292-“I would be honored, my lord.”
3293-Hades looked at her then. “I will leave you in Thanatos’s care.”
3294-“Will I see you later?” she asked.
3295-“If you wish.” He lifted her hand to his lips.
3297-Persephone turned to face Thanatos, meeting those striking blue eyes. “So you’re Thanatos.”
3298-The god smiled. “The very one.”
3300-“I confess, I have been eager to meet you,” Thanatos added. “The souls speak well of you.”
3301-She smiled. “I enjoy being with them. Until I visited Asphodel, I didn’t have a very peaceful view of the Underworld.”
3302-His smile was sympathetic, as if he understood. “I imagine so. The Upperworld has made death evil, and I suppose I cannot blame them.”
3303-“You’re very understanding,” she observed.
3304-“Well, I do spend a lot of time in the company of mortals, and always in their worst or hardest moments.”
3305-It seemed sad that this was Thanatos’s existence, but the God of Death quickly soothed, “Do not mourn for me, my lady. The shadow of death is often a comfort to the dying.”
3307-“Shall we find these souls you wish to speak to?” he asked, quickly changing the subject.
3308-“Yes, please.” She handed him the list she’d made her first day at New Athens News when she’d begun her research into Hades. “Can you take me to any of these?”
3309-She did not think that was a good sign. “If I may, why these souls?”
3310-“I believe they all had something in common before they died: a contract with Hades.”
3311-“They did.” It surprised Persephone that he knew so much. “And you wish to…interview them? For your paper?”
3312-“Yes.” Persephone found herself answering hesitantly, suddenly unsure.
3313-The God of Death folded the piece of paper and said, “I will take you to them. Though I think you will be disappointed.”
3315-The grass beneath her feet was golden and the trees tall and lush, heavy with fruit, completing the image of beauty and peace. “Where are we?”
3316-“These are the Elysium Fields. The list of names you offered, those souls reside here.”
3317-“I…don’t understand. Elysium is paradise.”
3319-Thanatos offered her a small smile, as if he understood her confusion. “It is a paradise. It is a sanctuary. It is where the pained come to heal in peace and solitude. It is where Hades sent the souls on the list you gave once they died.”
3320-Her heart felt lighter, unburdened by the frustration and anger she felt over the last couple of months. “Why? Did he feel guilty?”
3322-“He is the reason they died,” she explained. “He made a bargain with them, and when they couldn’t fulfill it, he took their souls.”
3323-“Ah,” Thanatos said. “You misunderstand. Hades does not decide when souls come to the Underworld. The Fates do.”
3324-“But he is the Lord of the Underworld. He makes the contracts!”
3325-“Hades is the Lord of the Underworld, but he is not death, nor is he destiny. You may see a bargain with a mortal, but Hades is really bargaining with the Fates. He can see the thread of each human’s life, knows when their soul is burdened, and wishes to change the trajectory. Sometimes the Fates weave a new future. Sometimes they cut the thread.”
3326-“Surely he has influence?”
3327-Thanatos shrugged. “It is a balance. We all understand that. Hades cannot save every soul, and not every soul wants to be saved.”
3331-“Why didn’t he tell me?” she snapped.
3333-Thanatos kept smiling. “Lord Hades is not in the habit of trying to convince the world he is a good god.”
3334-“You are the worst sort of god,” she’d told him.
3337-“Do they speak?” she asked.
3338-“Yes, but souls who reside in Elysium must drink from the Lethe. They cannot have memories from their time in the Upperworld if they are to reincarnate.”
3339-“How can they heal if they don’t possess memory?”
3340-“No soul has ever healed by dwelling on the past,” Thanatos answered.
3341-“When do they reincarnate?”
3342-“When they heal.”
3343-“And how long does it take for them to heal?”
3344-“It varies…months, years, decades, but there is no rush,” Thanatos answered. “All we have is time.”
3346-“There are a few souls who will incarnate within the week,” Thanatos said. “I believe the souls in Asphodel are planning a celebration. You should join them.”
3347-“What about you?” Persephone asked.
3348-He offered a small laugh. “I do not think the souls wish to have their reaper join them for a celebration.”
3349-“How do you know?”
3350-Thanatos opened his mouth, hesitated, then admitted, “I suppose I don’t.”
3351-“I think you should go. We all should, even Hades.”
3352-Thanatos’s brows rose and a smile broke out across his face. “You can count on my presence, my lady, though I cannot speak for Lord Hades.”
3353-They walked a little while in silence, and then Persephone said, “Hades does so much for his souls…except live alongside them.”
3355-“When Asphodel celebrated him, he told me he didn’t go because he wasn’t worthy of their celebration,” she added. “Why?”
3356-“Lord Hades carries many burdens, as we all do. The heaviest of them is regret.”
3357-“Regret for what?”
3358-“That he was not always so generous.”
3361-Thanatos offered her a small smile, as if he understood her confusion. “It is a paradise. It is a sanctuary. It is where the pained come to heal in peace and solitude. It is where Hades sent the souls on the list you gave once they died.”
3362-Her heart felt lighter, unburdened by the frustration and anger she felt over the last couple of months. “Why? Did he feel guilty?”
3364-“He is the reason they died,” she explained. “He made a bargain with them, and when they couldn’t fulfill it, he took their souls.”
3365-“Ah,” Thanatos said. “You misunderstand. Hades does not decide when souls come to the Underworld. The Fates do.”
3366-“But he is the Lord of the Underworld. He makes the contracts!”
3367-“Hades is the Lord of the Underworld, but he is not death, nor is he destiny. You may see a bargain with a mortal, but Hades is really bargaining with the Fates. He can see the thread of each human’s life, knows when their soul is burdened, and wishes to change the trajectory. Sometimes the Fates weave a new future. Sometimes they cut the thread.”
3368-“Surely he has influence?”
3369-Thanatos shrugged. “It is a balance. We all understand that. Hades cannot save every soul, and not every soul wants to be saved.”
3373-“Why didn’t he tell me?” she snapped.
3375-Thanatos kept smiling. “Lord Hades is not in the habit of trying to convince the world he is a good god.”
3376-“You are the worst sort of god,” she’d told him.
3379-“Do they speak?” she asked.
3380-“Yes, but souls who reside in Elysium must drink from the Lethe. They cannot have memories from their time in the Upperworld if they are to reincarnate.”
3381-“How can they heal if they don’t possess memory?”
3382-“No soul has ever healed by dwelling on the past,” Thanatos answered.
3383-“When do they reincarnate?”
3384-“When they heal.”
3385-“And how long does it take for them to heal?”
3386-“It varies…months, years, decades, but there is no rush,” Thanatos answered. “All we have is time.”
3388-“There are a few souls who will incarnate within the week,” Thanatos said. “I believe the souls in Asphodel are planning a celebration. You should join them.”
3389-“What about you?” Persephone asked.
3390-He offered a small laugh. “I do not think the souls wish to have their reaper join them for a celebration.”
3391-“How do you know?”
3392-Thanatos opened his mouth, hesitated, then admitted, “I suppose I don’t.”
3393-“I think you should go. We all should, even Hades.”
3394-Thanatos’s brows rose and a smile broke out across his face. “You can count on my presence, my lady, though I cannot speak for Lord Hades.”
3395-They walked a little while in silence, and then Persephone said, “Hades does so much for his souls…except live alongside them.”
3397-“When Asphodel celebrated him, he told me he didn’t go because he wasn’t worthy of their celebration,” she added. “Why?”
3398-“Lord Hades carries many burdens, as we all do. The heaviest of them is regret.”
3399-“Regret for what?”
3400-“That he was not always so generous.”
3403-“Come, my lady,” Thanatos said. “I will show you back to the palace.”
3404-As the two walked, she asked, “How long has it been since he hosted a party at the palace?”
3405-Thanatos’s brows rose. “I don’t know that he ever has.”
3408-Hecate’s eyes widened. “You’re sure?”
3409-Persephone nodded. “Can you help me, Hecate?”
3411-“My dear,” Hecate said. “Of course I’ll help you.”
3422-“I’m back!” Lexa called.
3423-Persephone smiled and poured her a cup, sliding it across the counter as she came into view. “How was your weekend?”
3424-Lexa beamed. “Magical.”
3426-“I’m happy for you, Lex.” She’d said it before, and she’d say it many times after.
3427-“Thanks for the coffee.” Lexa started toward her room but paused. “Oh, I meant to ask. How was the Underworld?”
3428-Persephone froze. “What do you mean?”
3429-“Persephone. I know you left with Hades Saturday night. It’s all anyone could talk about—the girl in red, stolen to the Underworld.”
3430-She paled. “Did anyone—no one knew it was me, right?”
3431-Lexa looked a little sympathetic. “I mean, Hades had just announced the Halcyon Project, which was inspired by you, so people came to their own conclusions.”
3434-“I know you’d rather not acknowledge whatever’s going on between you and Hades,” Lexa added, “but I’m your best friend. “but I’m your best friend. You can tell me anything. You know that, right?”
3435-“I know, I know. I really didn’t intend to leave with him. I was going to call a cab and then…” Her voice trailed away.
3436-“He swept you off your feet?” Lexa waggled her brows, and Persephone couldn’t help but laugh. “Just tell me one thing. Did he kiss you?”
3437-Persephone blushed and admitted, “Yes.”
3438-Lexa squealed. “Oh my gods, Persephone! You have to tell me everything!”
3439-Persephone looked at the clock. “I have to go—lunch with Sybil?”
3440-“I wouldn’t miss it for the world.”
3443-“Hey, Persephone,” Adonis said as he joined her.
3444-She glanced at him. “I don’t really feel like talking to you.”
3445-He was probably shocked his smile hadn’t worked its usual magic. “You’re really just gonna stop talking to me? You know that’s impossible. We work together.”
3446-“I’ll still be professional,” she said.
3447-“You aren’t being very professional right now.”
3448-“Actually, I don’t have to make small talk with you to be professional. I just have to get my job done.”
3449-“Or you could forgive me,” Adonis said. “I was drunk, and I barely touched you.”
3452-“Is this about Hades?” he demanded. “Are you sleeping with him?”
3453-“That is not an appropriate question, Adonis, and it’s also none of your business.”
3454-“He told you to stay away from me, didn’t he?”
3455-“I am capable of making my own decisions. I thought you would remember that after you stole my article,” she snapped. “But just so we’re clear, I don’t want to talk to you because you are a manipulator, you never take responsibility for your mistakes, and you kissed me when I specifically told you not to, which makes you a predator.”
3457-“You bitch!”
3458-“Adonis.” Demetri’s voice cut through their conversation like a whip.
3458-She had never thought him capable of the anger she saw on his face. “A moment.”
3460-He muttered under his breath, “This is ridiculous. She’s a snitch.”
3461-“You told on yourself,” Demetri said.
3463-When Demetri returned, he approached Persephone’s desk. “You have a moment?”
3464-“Yeah,” she said quietly and followed him into his office.
3465-Once inside, she took a seat, and Demetri did the same. “Want to tell me what happened?”
3467-“Why didn’t you tell me?”
3468-Persephone shrugged. “I wanted to submit it anyway. It just happened faster than I anticipated.”
3469-Demetri grimaced. “In the future, I want you to come to me when you feel wronged, Persephone. Your satisfaction in this job is important to me.”
3470-“I…appreciate that.”
3471-“And I will understand if you want to cease writing articles about Hades.”
3472-She stared at him. “You would? But why?”
3473-“I won’t pretend that I’m not aware of the frustration and stress it has caused you,” he said, and she had to admit, she was a little surprised he’d noticed. “You became famous overnight and you’re not even finished with college yet.”
3474-She let her eyes fall to her hands, twisting her fingers nervously. “But what about the readership?”
3475-Demetri shrugged. “That’s the thing about news. There’s always something new.”
3477-“No,” she said. “It’s okay. I want to continue with the series…for now.”
3478-Demetri smiled. “Alright, but if you wish to end it, I want you to let me know.”
3483-“You’re Persephone Rosi, right?”
3485-“I am,” she said hesitantly. “Can I…help you?”
3489-“beautiful, blond mortal”—was that they’d sourced a picture of her.
3490-“Is it true?” the girl asked. “Are you really dating Lord Hades?”
3492-Instead of answering the girl, she asked, “You do know the Divine is a gossip magazine?”
3493-“Yes, but…he created the Halcyon Project just for you.”
3494-“It isn’t for me.” Persephone pushed past the girl. “It’s for mortals in need.”
3495-“Still, don’t you think that’s romantic?”
3496-Persephone paused and turned to face the girl. “He listened. There’s nothing romantic about that.”
3498-Persephone explained, “I’m not interested in romanticizing Hades for doing something all men should be doing.”
3499-“So you don’t think he likes you?” the girl asked.
3500-“I’d much rather he respect me,” Persephone answered.
3501-“Excuse me,” she said and left.
3504-When he pulled away, he stared at her a moment, then asked, “Are you well?”
3506-“Yes,” she answered breathlessly.
3506-Instead, she asked, “What are you doing here?”
3507-The corners of his mouth turned up, and he brushed his thumb over the bottom of her lip. “I came to say goodbye.”
3508-“What?” The question came out more demanding than she wanted.
3509-He chuckled under his breath. “I must go to Olympia for Council.”
3510-“Oh.” She lowered her head, disappointed. “How long?”
3511-He shrugged. “If I have anything to say about it, a day and no more.”
3512-“Why wouldn’t you have a say?”
3513-“It depends on how much Zeus and Poseidon argue.”
3515-He plucked it from the top of her things and frowned—then frowned deeper after she asked, “Is this why you announced the Halcyon Project at the gala? So people would focus on something other than my assessment of your character?”
3516-“You think I created the Halcyon Project for my reputation?”
3517-She shrugged. “You didn’t want me to continue writing about you. You said so yesterday.”
3518-He stared at her for a moment, clearly frustrated. “I didn’t start the Halcyon Project in hopes that the world would admire me. I started it because of you.”
3519-“Why?”
3520-“Because I saw truth in what you said. Is that really so hard to believe?”
3522-“My absence will not affect your ability to enter the Underworld. You may come and go as you please.”
3523-“Before you go, I was thinking,” she said and reached for the lapels of his jacket. “I’d like to throw a party in the Underworld…for the souls.”
3524-His eyes were searching, and she wasn’t sure if he would push her away or pull her closer. “What kind of party?”
3525-“Thanatos tells me souls will reincarnate at the end of the week and that Asphodel is already planning a celebration. I think we should move it to the palace.”
3526-“We?”
3527-“I’m asking you if I can plan a party in the Underworld.” He just stared at her, so she went on, “Hecate has already agreed to help. “Hecate has already agreed to help.”
3528-His brows rose. “Has she?”
3529-“Yes.” Her eyes fell to where her palms now rested, flat on his chest. “She’s thinking we should have a ball.”
3531-“Are you trying to seduce me so I’ll agree to your ball?” he asked.
3532-“Is it working?”
3533-“It’s working.” He kissed her thoroughly and released her. “Plan your ball, Lady Persephone.”
3534-“Come home soon, Lord Hades.”
3540-It all started because Lexa asked Sybil, “So are you and Apollo…?”
3541-“Dating? No,” Sybil said. “But I think he hopes I will agree to be his lover.”
3543-“Wait,” Lexa said. “He asked? Like…for permission?”
3544-Sybil smirked, and Persephone admired how the oracle could talk about this so easily. “He did, and I told him no.”
3545-“You told Apollo, the God of the Sun, perfection incarnate, no?” Lexa looked slightly appalled. “Why?”
3546-“Lexa, you can’t ask that!” Persephone chided.
3547-Sybil just smiled and said, “Apollo will not love one person, and I do not wish to share.”
3553-“Hecate?” Persephone asked, knocking on the doorframe, but the goddess didn’t stir.
3553-She stepped farther into the room. “Hecate?”
3556-When she recognized Persephone, she smiled. “Welcome back, my lady.”
3557-“Persephone,” she corrected, and Hecate’s smile widened.
3558-“I’m only trying it out,” she said. “You know, for when you become mistress of the Underworld.”
3559-Persephone blushed fiercely. “You’re getting ahead of yourself, Hecate.”
3561-“What were you doing?” Persephone asked.
3562-“Oh, just cursing a mortal,” Hecate replied almost cheerfully, grabbing the candle and getting to her feet.
3562-She put it away and turned to face Persephone. “Watered your garden already, dear?”
3563-“Yes.”
3564-“Shall we begin?”
3566-“Amazing,” Persephone whispered.
3568-“You must practice calling to your magic,” Hecate said.
3569-“How do I do that?”
3570-“Magic is malleable. As you call for it, imagine it as clay—mold it into what you desire and then…give it life.”
3571-Persephone shook her head. “You make it sound so easy.”
3572-“It is easy,” Hecate said. “All it takes is belief.”
3574-Hecate must have noticed her disappointment, because she placed a hand on Persephone’s shoulder. “It will take time, but you will master this.”
3576-“Persephone?”
3577-“Huh?”
3579-“Thinking of our king?”
3580-Persephone looked away. “Everyone knows, don’t they?”
3581-“Well, he did carry you through the palace to his bedroom.”
3582-She hadn’t intended to have this conversation, and though it pained her to speak the words, she said, “I’m not sure it should have happened.”
3583-“Why ever not?”
3584-“For so many reasons, Hecate.”
3586-“The contract, for one,” Persephone explained.
3586-“And my mother will never let me out of her sight again if she finds out.” She paused. “What if she can see it when she looks at me? What if she knows I’m not the virginal goddess she’s always wanted?”
3587-Hecate chuckled. “No god has the power to determine if you are a virgin.”
3588-“Not a god but a mother.”
3589-Hecate frowned. “Do you regret sleeping with Hades? Forget your mother and the contract—do you regret it?”
3590-“No. I could never regret him.”
3591-“My dear, you are at war with yourself. It has created darkness within you.”
3592-“Darkness?”
3593-“Anger, fear, resentment,” Hecate said. “If you do not free yourself first, no one else can.”
3598-“When did you feel life for the first time?” Hecate asked, curious.
3599-“After Hades and I…” She didn’t need to finish her sentence.
3600-“Hmm.” The Goddess of Magic tapped her chin. “I think, perhaps, the God of the Dead has created life within you.”
3603-She knew he planned to be at the Ascension Ball this evening, because when she arrived in the Underworld to help decorate, Hecate ushered her into another part of the palace to get ready and greeted her with, “Lord Hades has sent your gown. It’s beautiful.”
3604-Persephone had no idea Hades planned on sending her a gown at all. “May I see it?”
3605-“Later, dear,” Hecate said, opening a set of gilded doors to a suite unlike the rest of the palace.
3606-“These rooms, who are they for?” Persephone asked as she entered, trailing her fingers along the edge of a white vanity.
3607-“The mistress of the Underworld,” Hecate replied.
3609-“But…Hades has never had a wife,” Persephone hedged.
3610-“He has not.”
3611-“So…these rooms have never been occupied?”
3612-“Not that we are aware. Come. Let’s get you ready.”
3614-“Ah, Lord Hades said you loved them.”
3615-“I don’t recall telling Hades my favorite scents.”
3616-“I don’t suppose you had to,” Hecate said absently. “He can smell them.”
3618-“It’s beautiful,” Persephone told the lampades. “I love it.”
3619-“Just wait until you see your gown,” Hecate said.
3621-“You are a vision,” Hecate said.
3622-Persephone smiled. “Thank you, Hecate.”
3624-“This is the closest I have ever looked to a goddess,” she said aloud, smoothing her hands over her dress.
3625-She met his dark eyes in the mirror and started to turn, but Hades’s voice rang out, “Don’t move. Let me look at you.”
3627-When he finished, he wrapped an arm around her waist, pulling her back against his chest, welding their bodies together. “Drop your glamour.”
3628-In truth, her human glamour was her security, and Hades’s command made her want to hold on to it tighter. “Why?”
3629-“Because I wish to see you,” he said.
3630-Her grip tightened on the glamour, but Hades coaxed in a voice that made her melt, “Let me see you.”
3632-“Open your eyes,” Hades encouraged, and when she did, she was in her goddess form.
3634-“Darling, you are a goddess,” Hades said and pressed his lips to her shoulder.
3635-“I have missed you.” He cupped her face, eyes searching.
3636-“I missed you too.”
3638-“I am just as eager, my darling,” he said. “But if we do not leave now, I think we shall miss your party.”
3640-“Shall we?” he asked, holding out his hand.
3642-“Careful, Goddess,” Hades warned in a low growl. “Or we won’t leave this room.”
3649-As they made their way through the crowd, Persephone smiled and nodded, and when her eyes fell on Hecate, she broke from Hades to take her hands. “Hecate! You look beautiful!”
3651-“You flatter me, my dear,” she said as they embraced.
3654-He bowed, one hand covering his heart. “My lady, may I have the next dance?”
3655-She smiled and took his hand. “Of course!”
3657-“My lady,” he said.
3658-“It’s Persephone, Hermes,” she said, taking his hand.
3659-“You look almost as amazing as me,” he said smugly as they moved about the room.
3660-“What a thoughtful compliment,” she teased.
3661-The god grinned and then leaned in. “I can’t tell if it’s the dress or all the sex you’ve been having with the god of this realm.”
3662-Persephone blushed. “Not funny, Hermes!”
3663-He lifted a brow. “Isn’t it?”
3664-“How do you even know?”
3665-“Well, it’s rumored he carried you through the palace to his bed.”
3667-“I see it’s true.”
3669-“So tell me—how was it?”
3670-“I’m not going to talk to you about it, Hermes.”
3671-“I bet he’s rough,” Hermes mused.
3672-Persephone looked away both to hide her blush and her laugh. “You’re impossible.”
3673-Hermes chuckled. “But truly—love looks good on you.”
3674-“Love?” she almost choked.
3675-“Oh dear. You haven’t realized it yet, have you?”
3676-“Realized what?”
3677-“That you’re in love with Hades.”
3678-“I’m not!”
3679-“Are too,” he said. “And he loves you.”
3680-“I almost preferred your questions about my sex life,” she muttered.
3681-Hermes laughed. “You walked into this room like you were his queen. You think he would let just anyone do that?”
3683-“I think the Lord of the Underworld has found his bride.”
3684-She wanted to argue that Hades hadn’t found her—he’d captured her—but instead of saying that, she raised her brow at the God of Trickery. “Hermes, are you drunk?”
3685-“A little,” he admitted sheepishly.
3689-“It’s alright, Sephy.” He released her. “Go to him.”
3690-Persephone hesitated. “It’s okay—”
3691-“Claim him, Persephone.”
3693-“My lord, will you dance?”
3696-“Are you displeased?” she asked after some time.
3697-“Am I displeased that you have danced with Charon and Hermes?” he asked.
3698-Was that what she was asking? She stared at him and he leaned forward, pressing his lips against her ear. “I am displeased that I am not inside you.”
3699-She tried not to smile. “My lord, why didn’t you say so?”
3700-His eyes darkened. “Careful, Goddess. I have no qualms taking you before my whole realm.”
3701-“You wouldn’t.”
3705-“Where are we going?” she asked.
3706-“To remedy my displeasure,” he replied.
3710-“Why did you ask me to drop my glamour?” she asked.
3711-Hades brushed a stray piece of hair behind her ear. “I told you—you will not hide here. You needed to understand what it is to be a god.”
3712-“I’m not like you,” she said.
3713-His hands trailed up her arms and he smiled. “No, we have only two things in common.”
3714-She raised a brow. “And those are?”
3715-“We are both Divine,” he said, inching closer. “And the space we share.”
3716-His forehead rested against hers, and she inhaled a shaky breath. “Is this what it’s like to be a god?”
3717-“This is what it is like to have my favor,” he answered and moved, sliding in and out, invading her in the most delicious way.
3719-“You are perfect,” he said, fingers twisting into her hair.
3720-“You are beautiful. I have never wanted like I want with you.”
3723-“Watch,” he said.
3725-“The souls are returning to the mortal world,” Hades said. “This is reincarnation.”
3727-“It’s beautiful,” she said.
3730-“What?” she asked.
3731-“Let me worship you,” he said.
3732-“You will worship me, and I won’t even have to order you.” His request felt sinful and devious, and she reveled in it.
3733-She answered, “Yes.”
3740-One evening, after a particularly intense game of strip poker, they lay in bed, Persephone’s head on Hades’s chest while he brushed his fingers absently through her hair. “Allow me to take you to dinner.”
3741-Her gaze snapped to his. “Dinner? Like…out in public?”
3744-“Not in public exactly,” he said. “But I do want to take you to a public restaurant.”
3746-“I would keep you safe.”
3748-“Okay,” she said and smiled.
3754-“What the hell, Adonis?” she demanded. “Where did you get the photos?”
3755-“I’m sure you’d like to know.”
3756-“Hades will crush you.”
3757-“He can try, but then he probably doesn’t want to face Aphrodite’s wrath.”
3758-“You’re a bastard.”
3759-“You have three weeks,” he said.
3760-“How am I supposed to get your job back for you?” she snapped.
3761-“You’ll think of something. You did get me fired.”
3762-“You got yourself fired, Adonis,” she hissed. “You shouldn’t have stolen my article.”
3763-“I made you famous,” he argued.
3764-“You didn’t make me anything but a victim, and I’m not interested in continuing that trend.”
3765-There was a long pause on the other side before Adonis spoke again. “Time is running out, Persephone.”
3766-The easiest thing to do was to ask Demetri if he’d consider hiring Adonis back, so she rose from her seat and knocked on his door. “Do you have a moment?”
3767-Her boss looked up from his computer, glasses reflecting his blue shirt and yellow tie, making eye contact almost impossible. “Yes, come in.”
3768-Persephone only took a few steps into the room. “What are the chances Adonis could…come back?”
3769-“Why?”
3770-“Just feeling…a little bad for him is all,” she managed, though the words tasted like blood in her mouth.
3771-She could now see his eyes, full of concern and a little suspicious. “Is everything alright?”
3772-She nodded. “Yes. Yeah. Excuse me.”
3778-She must have looked troubled when Hades arrived to pick her up, because the God of the Underworld asked as she approached his limo, “Is everything okay?”
3779-“Yes,” she managed in her cheeriest voice possible.
3779-He had been asking that a lot, and she wondered if he was paranoid. “It was just a busy day.”
3780-He smiled. “Then let’s get you off your feet.”
3782-“My lady.” He bowed his head.
3783-“It is good to see you, Antoni.”
3784-“Just press the com if you need anything.” Then he rolled up a tinted window that kept his cabin separate from theirs.
3786-Maybe it was the stress of the day or the tension in the cabin, but right now, all she wanted was to lose herself in him. “I want to worship you.”
3788-“And how would you worship me, Goddess?” His voice was deep and controlled.
3789-She tried to repress a smile and kneeled to the floorboard in front of him, wedging herself between his legs. “Shall I show you?”
3790-His throat worked, and he managed in a husky tone, “A demonstration would be appreciated.”
3793-“Fuck,” he said and reached for the intercom button.
3793-When Hades spoke, he was breathless. “Antoni. Drive until I say otherwise.”
3794-“Yes, sir.”
3797-When she finished, Hades reached for her, dragging her up for a hard kiss before tearing away to growl, “I want you.”
3798-She tilted her head, questioning. “How do you want me?”
3799-He answered without so much as a second thought. “To start, I’ll take you from behind on your hands and knees.”
3800-“And then?”
3801-“I’ll pull you on top and teach you how to ride me until you come apart.”
3802-“Hmm, I like that one.”
3803-She bit his ear, and when he groaned, she whispered, “Tell me how I feel.”
3804-“Like life,” he answered.
3807-“Where are we?” she asked.
3808-“The Grove,” Hades replied. “My restaurant.”
3809-“You own the Grove?” It was a favorite among the mortals of New Athens because of its unique decor and cozy, garden-inspired dining. “How does no one know?”
3810-“I let Ilias run it,” he said. “And prefer that people think he owns it.”
3812-“This is beautiful, Hades.”
3814-When they finished eating, they walked through the forest on the roof and Persephone asked, “What do you do for fun?”
3816-“What do you mean?”
3817-She laughed. “The fact that you just asked that says everything. What are your hobbies?”
3818-“Cards. Riding.” He swirled his hand in the air, thinking. “Drinking.”
3819-“What about things not related to being the God of the Dead?”
3820-“Drinking is not related to being God of the Dead.”
3821-“It also isn’t a hobby. Unless you’re an alcoholic.”
3822-Hades raised a brow. “Then what are your hobbies?”
3823-Persephone smiled, and though she knew he was avoiding talking about himself, she answered, “Baking.”
3824-“Baking? I feel like I should have known about this sooner.”
3825-“Well, you never asked.”
3826-Persephone turned to look at him when he said, “Teach me.”
3827-She stared at him for a moment, stunned. “What?”
3828-“Teach me,” he said. “To bake something.”
3829-She couldn’t help but laugh, and he raised a brow, clearly not amused. “I’m sorry. I’m just imagining you in my kitchen.”
3830-“And that’s difficult?”
3831-“Well…yeah. You’re the God of the Underworld.”
3832-“And you’re the Goddess of Spring,” he said. “You stand in your kitchen and make cookies. Why can’t I?”
3835-She hadn’t realized she was frowning until he touched her face, brushing her cheek with his finger. “Are you well?”
3836-“Very well.” She stood on the tips of her toes and pressed a kiss to his mouth, pulling away. “I’ll teach you.”
3837-Hades smiled too. “Well then. Let’s get started.”
3838-“Wait. You want to learn now?”
3839-“Now is as good a time as any,” he said.
3840-“I thought maybe…we could spend time at your apartment.” She stared at him, and he shrugged. “You’re always in the Underworld.”
3841-“You…want to spend time in the Upperworld? In my apartment?”
3843-“I…have to prepare Lexa for your arrival.”
3844-“Fair enough. I’ll have Antoni drop you off.” He looked down at his suit. “I need to change.”
3847-Jaison lowered the lamp. “I heard someone scream.”
3848-“And you were going to save me with a lamp?” Lexa asked.
3849-“It was the heaviest thing I could find,” he said defensively.
3851-Jaison rubbed the back of his neck. “Wow, Hades, huh?”
3852-“Yes, Hades!” Lexa reached for Jaison’s hand. “Come on! We have to clean the living room. He’s going to think we’re peasants.”
3856-“Did you own those before today?” she asked, pointing to the pants.
3857-Hades looked down at them, grinning. “No.”
3859-“What?” he asked.
3860-“Nothing,” she said quickly and moved around him.
3860-She brought him into the living room where Lexa and Jaison had finished cleaning and now lounged on the couch. “Um, Hades, this is Lexa, my best friend, and Jaison, her boyfriend.”
3863-“It’s nice to meet you,” she said.
3864-“Very few have ever spoken those words,” he told her.
3865-Lexa pulled away and grinned. “So long as you treat my best friend right, I’ll continue to be happy to see you.”
3866-“Noted, Lexa Sideris,” he said and gave a little bow. “May I say, it is a pleasure to meet you.”
3870-“Why do you put everything up so high?” he asked as he helped retrieve her supplies.
3871-“It’s the only place it will fit. In case you haven’t noticed, I don’t live in a palace.”
3873-When everything was on the counter, Hades turned to look at her. “What would you do without me?”
3874-“Get it myself,” she said simply.
3875-He was absolutely breathtaking, and she wanted to laugh because he was standing in her ugly kitchen making cookies. “Well, get over here. You can’t learn from there.”
3877-His mouth touched her ear, warm and honeyed. “Please, instruct.”
3878-She took a breath and cleared her throat. “The most important thing to remember when baking is that the ingredients have to be measured and mixed right or it could mean disaster.”
3879-Her breath caught, and she added, “Scratch that. The most important thing to remember is to pay attention.”
3881-“First, flour,” she said.
3883-“Next?”
3884-Concentrate, she commanded herself. “Baking soda.”
3887-“We make icing.” She rubbed her hands together.
3889-“What am I supposed to do with this?”
3890-“You’ll beat the ingredients together,” she said, pouring powdered sugar, vanilla, and corn syrup into a bowl.
3890-She pushed it toward him. “Beat.”
3891-He smirked. “Happily.”
3893-“How does it taste?” he asked and drew her fingers deep into his mouth, sucking them clean.
3893-He groaned. “Delicious.”
3895-There was a long pause, and Hades asked, “Now what?”
3899-“Lexa.” Persephone blushed. “What’s up?”
3900-“I was wondering if you guys wanted to watch a movie?”
3901-“Say no,” Hades whispered against her ear.
3902-Persephone laughed and asked, “What movie?”
3903-“Clash of the Titans?”
3904-Hades snorted and drew away from her, looking at Lexa. “Old or new?”
3905-“Old.”
3906-“Fine,” he said, and then he kissed Persephone on the cheek. “Going to need a minute.”
3907-When Hades was out of sight, Lexa started. “Okay, first. Not in the kitchen! Second, he’s completely in love with you.”
3908-Persephone’s cheeks heated. “Stop, Lexa.”
3909-“Girl, he worships you.”
3913-Hades’s arms tightened around her, and he whispered against her ear. “I know what you’re thinking.”
3914-“You can’t possibly know.”
3915-“After what I put myself through this evening, I’m sure there are several things you are laughing at.”
3916-“Don’t leave,” she said sleepily when he lowered her onto the bed.
3917-“I’m not.” He kissed her forehead. “Sleep.”
3921-“You are beautiful,” he said.
3922-“You feel good,” she said, hissing as she took in breath between her teeth, fighting the pressure building behind her eyes.
3922-The longer she experienced this euphoria, the less control she had. “You feel…like power.”
3929-“Persephone.” A note of panic colored his voice. “Did I hurt you?”
3930-“No,” she whispered, covering her eyes.
3930-She took in a shaky breath. “No, you didn’t hurt me.”
3932-He kissed her hair and whispered, “You are too perfect for me.”
3934-“Come back to bed,” she said.
3935-“Get away from my daughter.” Demeter’s voice thundered throughout the room.
3936-She sat up, clutching her blanket to her chest. “Mother! Get out!”
3938-“How dare you.” Demeter’s voice shook, and Persephone wasn’t sure if she was talking to her or Hades—maybe both.
3940-“How long?” Demeter asked.
3941-“It’s really none of your business, Mother,” Persephone snapped.
3942-Her mother’s eyes darkened. “You forget your place, Daughter.”
3943-“And you forget my age. I am not a child!”
3944-“You are my child, and you have betrayed my trust.”
3946-“No, Mother!” Persephone looked frantically to Hades, and he looked back, tense but calm.
3947-“You will no longer live this disgraceful, mortal life!”
3951-“What did you do?” This time, Demeter looked at Hades.
3952-“Don’t touch me!” Persephone tried to wrench away, but Demeter’s hold tightened, and Persephone cried out.
3953-“Release her, Demeter.” Hades’s voice was calm, but there was something deadly in his eyes.
3954-“Don’t you dare tell me what to do with my daughter!”
3956-“Your daughter and I have a contract,” Hades explained. “She will stay until she fulfills it.”
3957-“No.” Demeter’s gaze focused on Persephone’s wrist, and she got the sense her mother would do just about anything to take her from this place, including cutting her hand off. “You will remove your mark. Remove it, Hades!”
3960-“You are beautiful,” he said.
3961-“You feel good,” she said, hissing as she took in breath between her teeth, fighting the pressure building behind her eyes.
3961-The longer she experienced this euphoria, the less control she had. “You feel…like power.”
3968-“Persephone.” A note of panic colored his voice. “Did I hurt you?”
3969-“No,” she whispered, covering her eyes.
3969-She took in a shaky breath. “No, you didn’t hurt me.”
3971-He kissed her hair and whispered, “You are too perfect for me.”
3973-“Come back to bed,” she said.
3974-“Get away from my daughter.” Demeter’s voice thundered throughout the room.
3975-She sat up, clutching her blanket to her chest. “Mother! Get out!”
3977-“How dare you.” Demeter’s voice shook, and Persephone wasn’t sure if she was talking to her or Hades—maybe both.
3979-“How long?” Demeter asked.
3980-“It’s really none of your business, Mother,” Persephone snapped.
3981-Her mother’s eyes darkened. “You forget your place, Daughter.”
3982-“And you forget my age. I am not a child!”
3983-“You are my child, and you have betrayed my trust.”
3985-“No, Mother!” Persephone looked frantically to Hades, and he looked back, tense but calm.
3986-“You will no longer live this disgraceful, mortal life!”
3990-“What did you do?” This time, Demeter looked at Hades.
3991-“Don’t touch me!” Persephone tried to wrench away, but Demeter’s hold tightened, and Persephone cried out.
3992-“Release her, Demeter.” Hades’s voice was calm, but there was something deadly in his eyes.
3993-“Don’t you dare tell me what to do with my daughter!”
3995-“Your daughter and I have a contract,” Hades explained. “She will stay until she fulfills it.”
3996-“No.” Demeter’s gaze focused on Persephone’s wrist, and she got the sense her mother would do just about anything to take her from this place, including cutting her hand off. “You will remove your mark. Remove it, Hades!”
3997-The god clearly wasn’t fazed by Demeter’s growing anger. “The contract must be fulfilled, Demeter. The Fates command it.”
3998-The Goddess of Harvest paled when she looked at Persephone. “How could you?”
3999-“How could I?” Persephone echoed sharply. “It’s not like I wanted this to happen, Mother!”
4001-“Didn’t you? I warned you about him!” Demeter pointed to Hades. “I warned you to stay away from the gods!”
4002-“And in doing so, you left me to this fate.”
4003-Demeter lifted her chin. “So you blame me? When all I did was try to protect you? Well, you will see the truth very soon, Daughter.”
4006-“When the contract is fulfilled, you will come home with me,” Demeter said, and Persephone glared up at her. “You will never return to this mortal life and you will never see Hades again.”
4008-All she could manage to say was, “I don’t regret you. I didn’t mean that I regretted you.”
4009-“I know.” Hades kissed her tears away.
4010-There was a knock on the door and they both looked up to find Lexa standing just inside the room, eyes wide. “What the fuck?”
4012-“Lexa,” she said. “I have something to tell you.”
4016-“Why did you keep it from me?” Lexa asked.
4017-“It was an agreement I made with my mom,” Persephone said. “Plus, I wanted to know what it was like to live a normal life.”
4018-“I get that,” Lexa said.
4018-“Man, your mother is a bitch,” she said and then hunkered down as if she expected lightning to strike her. “Will she kill me for saying that?”
4019-“She’s too angry with me and full of hatred for Hades to even think about you,” Persephone replied.
4020-Luckily, Hades helped her call up a human glamour. “I can’t believe you’re the Goddess of Spring. What can you do?”
4021-“Well, that’s the thing. I’m just now learning my powers. Up until recently, I couldn’t even feel my magic. I used to want to be like the other gods,” she said. “But when my powers never developed, I just wanted to be somewhere where I was good at something.”
4022-Lexa placed her hand on Persephone’s. “You are good at so many things, Persephone. Especially at being a goddess.”
4023-Persephone scoffed. “How would you know? You just found out what I was.”
4024-“I know because you are kind and compassionate and you fight for your beliefs, but mostly, you fight for people. That’s what gods are supposed to do, and someone should remind them, because a lot of them have forgotten.” Lexa paused. “Maybe that’s why you were born.”
4026-“I love you, Lex.”
4027-“I love you too, Persephone.”
4030-When she’d said as much to Lexa, her best friend had responded, “Just talk to him. He’s the God of the Dead. Can’t he help?”
4035-Valerie was already standing behind her desk when Persephone stepped off the elevator, and she stopped her to whisper before she headed to her desk. “Persephone, there’s a woman here to see you. She says she has a story on Hades.”
4036-“Did you vet her?” Persephone had given Valarie a list of questions to ask anyone who called claiming they had a story about Hades.
4037-“She seems legitimate, although I think she’s lying about her name.”
4038-Persephone tilted her head. “Why?”
4039-She shrugged. “I don’t know. It was the way she said it. Like it was an afterthought.”
4040-That didn’t make Persephone feel too confident. “What name?”
4041-“Carol.”
4043-Then Valerie offered, “If you want someone to go with you into the interview, I can.”
4044-“No,” Persephone said. “That’s okay. Thanks, though.”
4046-“So you have a story for me?” she said, looking up.
4047-“A story? Oh, no, Lady Persephone—I have a bargain.”
4049-“Aphrodite.” Persephone’s breath left her.
4049-Why was the Goddess of Love here to see her? “What are you doing here?”
4050-“I thought I would pay you a visit, seeing as you are close to the end of your contract with Hades.”
4051-Persephone covered her wrist unconsciously, though the mark was hidden by a bracelet. “How do you know about that?”
4052-Aphrodite smiled, but there was pity in her gaze. “I fear Hades has placed you in the middle of our bet.”
4054-“Bet?” she echoed.
4055-Aphrodite pursed her lips. “I see he has not told you.”
4056-“You can drop the false concern, Aphrodite, and get to the point.”
4058-“My, my,” Aphrodite said. “You are awfully demanding. Perhaps that is why Hades likes you so much.”
4060-“I challenged Hades to a game of cards. It was all for fun, but he lost. My wager was that he had to make someone fall in love with him within six months,” she said.
4063-“I must admit, I was impressed with how quickly he zeroed in on you. Not an hour after I set my terms, he lured you into a contract, and I have been observing his progress ever since.”
4068-“I am sorry to hurt you,” Aphrodite said. “But I see now that I have truly lost.”
4070-“You do love him.”
4071-“Why would you be sorry?” Persephone asked through her teeth. “This is what you wanted.”
4072-The goddess shook her head. “Because…until today, I didn’t believe in love.”
4090-“Where are your brothers?” she asked, scratching behind his ear, and he responded by licking her face.
4090-Persephone pushed him away and got to her feet, scooping up the ball. “You want this?”
4092-“Fetch!” Persephone threw the ball.
4094-“Can you lead me to the Well of Reincarnation?” Persephone asked.
4097-“Cerberus!” Persephone called as he disappeared around another turn in the maze.
4101-“Cerberus, find a way out!” she commanded.
4104-“Cerberus!”
4110-“Help,” it rasped. “Water.”
4112-“H-hello?” she called to the dark.
4113-“The pillar,” the voice said.
4116-“Help,” he said again. “Water.”
4117-“Oh my gods.”
4119-“Careful,” she warned the faster he gulped. “You’ll be sick.”
4121-“Thank you,” he said.
4122-“Who are you?” she asked, studying his face.
4123-“My name”—he took a breath—“is Tantalus. “is Tantalus.”
4124-“And how long have you been here?”
4125-“I do not remember.” Every word he spoke was slow and seemed to take all his energy. “I was cursed to be eternally deprived of nourishment.”
4127-“I have begged daily for an audience with the lord of this realm so that I might find peace in Asphodel, but he will not hear my pleas. I have learned from my time here. I am not the same man I was all those long years ago. I swear it.”
4130-“You do not believe me,” he said, suddenly able to speak without pause.
4131-“I’m afraid I don’t know enough either way,” Persephone said, trying to remain as neutral as possible.
4132-At her words, the strange, angry glint that had clouded his eyes disappeared, and he nodded. “You are wise.”
4133-“I think I should go,” Persephone said.
4134-“Wait,” he called as she started to move. “A bite from the fruit—please.”
4141-“A goddess!” She heard Tantalus croon. “Come back, little goddess. I’ve been starved so long. I require a taste!”
4143-“No! Please—”
4144-“Persephone,” Hades said, pushing her back only a step.
4146-“Hades!” She threw her arms around him and sobbed.
4147-“Shh.” His lips pressed into her hair. “What are you doing here?”
4149-“Where are you, little bitch?”
4152-“My goddess was kind to you.” Hades’s voice was cold and resonant. “And this is how you repay her?”
4154-“You deserve to feel as I have felt—desperate and starved and alone!” Tantalus gritted out.
4156-“How do you know I haven’t felt like that for centuries, mortal?” he asked, and as he spoke, his glamour melted away.
4156-Hades stood clothed in darkness. “You are an ignorant mortal. Before, I was merely your jailer, but now I shall be your punisher, and I think my judges were too merciful. I’ll curse you with an unquenchable hunger and thirst. I’ll even put you within reach of food and water—but everything you partake of will be fire in your throat.”
4159-“Persephone.” His voice was warm and low—a plea. “Please don’t fear me. Not you.”
4163-“You are unwell,” he said. “Did he…hurt you?”
4165-“Tell me,” he begged. “Please.”
4166-“I know about Aphrodite, Hades.” His face changed at her words.
4166-She’d never seen him look so shocked or stricken. “I’m no more than a game to you.”
4167-He scowled. “I have never considered you a game, Persephone.”
4168-“The contract—”
4169-“This has nothing to do with the contract,” he all but snarled, releasing her.
4170-Persephone struggled to gain her footing in the water and shot back at him. “This has everything to do with the contract! Gods, I was so stupid! I let myself think you were good even with the possibility of being your prisoner.”
4171-“Prisoner? You would think yourself a prisoner here? Have I treated you so poorly?”
4172-“A kind jailer is still a jailer,” Persephone snapped.
4173-Hades’s face darkened. “If you considered me your warden, why did you fuck me?”
4174-“It was you who foretold this.” Her voice shook. “And you were right—I did enjoy it, and now that it’s done, we can move on.”
4175-“Move on?” His voice took on a deadly edge. “Is that what you want?”
4176-“We both know it’s for the best.”
4177-“I’m beginning to think you don’t know anything,” he said. “I’m beginning to understand that you don’t even think for yourself.”
4178-Those words pierced her like a blade to her sternum. “How dare you—”
4179-“How dare I what, Persephone? Call out your bullshit? You act so powerless, but you’ve never made a damn decision for yourself. Will you let your mother determine who you fuck now?”
4180-“Shut up!”
4181-“Tell me what you want.” He cornered her, pinning her against the edge of the pool.
4183-“Tell me!”
4184-“Fuck you!” She snarled and jumped, twining her legs around his waist.
4187-“Yes,” Hades said between his teeth and then commanded, “Use me. “Use me. Harder. Faster.”
4190-“Persephone,” he called.
4192-“I want to know why.” Persephone could feel something burning in her veins.
4192-It ignited deep in her belly and rushed through her like venom when he didn’t speak. “Was I an easy target? Did you look at my soul and see someone who was desperate for love, for worship? Did you choose me because you knew I couldn’t fulfill the terms of your bargain?”
4193-“It wasn’t like that.”
4195-“Then tell me what it was!” she seethed.
4196-“Yes, Aphrodite and I have a contract, but the bargain I struck with you had nothing to do with it.” She crossed her arms, prepared to reject that statement, when he added, “I offered you terms based on what I saw in your soul—a woman caged by her own mind. “I offered you terms based on what I saw in your soul—a woman caged by her own mind.”
4198-“You are the one who called the contract impossible,” he said. “But you are powerful, Persephone.”
4199-“Do not mock me.” Her voice shook.
4200-“I would never.”
4201-The sincerity in his voice made her sick. “Liar.”
4202-His eyes darkened. “I am many things, but a liar I am not.”
4203-“Not a liar then, but a self-admitted deceiver.”
4204-“I have only ever given you answers,” he said. “I have helped you reclaim your power, and yet you haven’t used it. I have given you a way to walk out from underneath your mother, and yet you will not claim it.”
4205-“How?” she demanded. “What did you do to help me?”
4206-“I worshipped you!” he yelled. “I gave you what your mother withheld—worshippers.”
4207-Persephone stood for a moment in stunned silence. “You mean to tell me you forced me into a contract when you could have just told me I needed worshippers to gain my powers?”
4208-“It’s not about powers, Persephone! It’s never been about magic or illusion or glamour. It’s about confidence. It’s about believing in yourself!”
4209-“That’s twisted, Hades—”
4210-“Is it?” he snapped.
4210-“Tell me, if you’d known, what would you have done? Announced your divinity to the whole world so that you might gain a following and consequently your power?” She knew the answer, and so did he. “No, you’ve never been able to decide what you want because you value your mother’s happiness over your own!”
4211-“I had freedom until you, Hades.”
4212-“You thought you were free before me?” he asked. “You just traded glass walls for another kind of prison when you came to New Athens.”
4213-“Why don’t you keep telling me how pathetic I am,” she spat.
4214-“That’s not what I—”
4215-“Isn’t it?” she cut him off.
4215-“Let me tell you what else makes me pathetic: I fell for you.” Tears stung her eyes.
4215-Hades moved to touch her, but she held out her hand. “Don’t!”
4216-She took a moment, waiting to speak until she was sure her voice was even. “What would Aphrodite have gotten if you had failed?”
4217-Hades swallowed and answered in a low, rough voice, “She asked that one of her heroes be returned to the living.”
4218-She should have known. “Well, you won. I love you. Was it worth it?”
4219-“You would believe Aphrodite’s words over my actions?”
4221-Instead, he shook his head and said, “You are your own prisoner.”
4226-“Well, Lady Persephone. It looks like you won.”
4235-Her best friend brushed her hair out of her face and asked, “Are you okay?”
4236-“Yes,” she said quietly.
4237-“Is it…over?”
4239-“I’m sorry, Persephone,” Lexa said and bent down to hug her close.
4245-“Lexa,” Persephone said. “Isn’t Jaison a programmer?”
4246-“Yeah…why?”
4247-“I have a job for him.”
4255-“What is he doing here?” Minthe snapped.
4256-“What’s she doing here?” Adonis asked.
4257-“It’s so I won’t have to repeat myself,” Persephone said.
4257-“I know Minthe took the photos you’re blackmailing me with.” Her phone buzzed and she checked it before adding, “Or rather, I should say, were blackmailing me with. “Or rather, I should say, were blackmailing me with. As of this second, your devices have been hacked and the photos removed.”
4259-“You can’t do that. It’s—it’s illegal!” Adonis argued.
4260-“Illegal like blackmail?”
4262-“I suppose you’ll run and tell on me?” the nymph asked.
4263-“Why would I do that?” Persephone’s question was genuine, but Minthe just seemed irritated, pressing her lips together and snarling.
4264-“Let’s not play act, Goddess. Revenge, of course. I’m surprised you didn’t tell Hades I was the one who sent you into Tartarus.”
4265-“Did she just call you Goddess?” Adonis jumped in, but glares from Minthe and Persephone had him silent again.
4266-“I prefer to fight my own battles,” Persephone said.
4267-“With what? Your words?” Minthe offered a sarcastic laugh.
4268-“I understand that you’re jealous of me,” Persephone said.
4268-“But your anger is misplaced.” If anything, she should be angry with Hades, or maybe angry with herself for wasting time pining after a man who didn’t love her.
4269-“You understand nothing!” Minthe seethed. “All these years, I stood beside him, only to wither in your shadow as he flaunted you to his whole kingdom like you were already his queen!”
4271-Then Minthe added in a shaky voice, “You were supposed to fall in love with him, not the other way around.”
4273-“Hades doesn’t love me,” Persephone said.
4274-“Stupid girl.” Minthe shook her head. “If you cannot see it, then maybe you aren’t worthy of him.”
4276-“Hades betrayed me.” Persephone’s voice shook.
4278-“How? Because he chose not to tell you about his contract with Aphrodite? Given that you wrote a derisive article about him within a few days of meeting him, I’m not at all surprised he didn’t confide in you. He was probably afraid that if you found out, you would act like the child you are.”
4280-“You should have been more thankful for your time in our world,” she added. “It’s the most powerful you will ever be.”
4282-“No,” Persephone said, and with a flick of her wrist, a vine shot out from the ground and curled around Minthe’s feet.
4282-As the nymph started to scream, another vine closed over her mouth, silencing her. “This is the most powerful I will ever be.”
4284-Adonis’s eyes went wide with disbelief. “Oh my gods! You—you—”
4286-“If you ever threaten me again, I will curse you,” she said, a deadly calm overtaking her voice.
4287-He spoke between breaths. “You…can’t…have… Aphrodite’s…favor!”
4290-His pain forgotten, he shrieked. “Turn me back! Turn me back!”
4292-“Please.” Tears spilled from his eyes. “Please. I’ll do anything. Anything.”
4293-“Anything?” Persephone echoed.
4294-“Yes! Just turn me back!”
4295-“A favor,” Persephone bargained. “To be collected at a future time.”
4296-“Whatever you want! Do it! Do it now!”
4298-“Do you know what a corpse lily is, Adonis?”
4300-“Don’t make me repeat myself, mortal.” She dropped her glamour and took a threatening step forward. “Yes or no?”
4301-Adonis’s eyes widened, and he wiggled away, whimpering, “No.”
4302-“Pity. It is a parasitic flower that smells like decaying flesh. I’m sure you’re wondering what this has to do with you. Well, it’s a wager. If you touch any woman without consent, I will turn you into one.”
4303-Adonis went pale but managed to glare at her. “A wager usually implies I get something in return.”
4304-“You do.” She leaned close.
4304-“Your life.” For emphasis, she held Minthe—the newly transformed mint plant—aloft, examining its green leaves. “She’ll make a fine addition to my garden.”
4306-“Who the fuck are you?” he called after her.
4307-“I am Persephone, Goddess of Spring,” she answered and disappeared.
4315-“Kore.”
4317-“Mother.” Persephone nodded.
4318-“I have been looking for you,” said Demeter, and her eyes fell to Persephone’s wrist. “But I see you have come to your senses and returned to me of your own volition.”
4319-“Actually, Mother, I came to say that I know what you did.”
4320-Her mother’s expression remained distant. “I don’t know what you mean.”
4321-“I know you kept me hidden here to prevent my powers from manifesting,” she said.
4322-Demeter lifted her head a fraction. “It was for your own good. I only ever did what I thought was best.”
4323-“What you thought was best,” Persephone repeated. “Didn’t you ever consider how I might feel?”
4324-“If you had just listened to me, none of this would have happened! You didn’t know any different until you left. That’s when you changed.” Demeter said it like it was a horrible thing—like she resented who Persephone had become.
4325-“You’re wrong,” Persephone argued. “I wanted adventure. I wanted to live outside these walls. You knew that. I begged you.”
4327-“You never gave me a choice—”
4328-“I couldn’t!” she snapped and then took a deep breath. “I suppose it didn’t matter in the end. It all happened as the Fates predicted.”
4329-“What?”
4330-Demeter glared. “When you were born, I went to the Fates and asked of your future. A goddess had not been born in ages, and I worried for you. They told me you were destined to be a Queen of Darkness, the Bride of Death. Hades’s wife. I could not let that happen. I did the only thing I could do—kept you hidden and safe.”
4331-“No, not safe,” Persephone said. “You did it so I would always need you, so you would never have to be alone.”
4332-The two stared at each other for a moment before Persephone added, “I know you do not believe in love, Mother, but you had no right to keep me from mine.”
4333-Demeter blinked in shock. “Love? You can’t…love Hades.”
4334-Persephone wished she didn’t; then she wouldn’t feel this aching in her chest. “See, that’s the problem with you trying to control my life. You’re wrong. You’ve always been wrong. I know I’m not the daughter you wanted, but I am the daughter you have, and if you want to be in my life, you will let me live it.”
4335-Demeter glared. “So this is it? You have come to tell me you’ve chosen Hades over me?”
4336-“No, I came to tell you that I forgive you…for everything.”
4337-Demeter’s expression was one of contempt. “You forgive me? It is you who should be begging for my forgiveness. I did everything for you!”
4338-“I don’t need your forgiveness to live an unburdened life, and I most certainly will not beg for it.”
4343-“Whenever you’re ready to reconcile, let me know.”
4346-“I am sorry, my flower, but I cannot allow you to leave. Not when I have just managed to reclaim you once again.”
4347-“I asked you to let me live.” Persephone’s voice shook.
4348-“And you will. Here. Where you belong.”
4349-“No.” Persephone’s fists curled.
4350-“In time, you will understand. This moment will be forgotten in the vastness of your lifetime.”
4353-“Things will be as they were before,” Demeter added.
4355-When Persephone began to shake, so did the ground, and Demeter frowned. “What is the meaning of this, Kore?”
4357-“Oh, Mother. You don’t understand, but everything has changed.”
4359-“What are you doing?” Demeter screamed over the sounds of bending metal and breaking glass.
4360-“Freeing myself,” Persephone replied—and vanished.
4392-“Hecate!” Persephone stood and threw her arms around the goddess’s neck. “I missed you.”
4393-“I missed you too, my dear.” She pulled away and studied Persephone’s face, her brows knitted together over her caring eyes. “We all do.”
4394-She’d essentially been avoiding everyone. “Sit with me?”
4395-“Of course.” The Goddess of Witchcraft took a seat beside Persephone.
4397-“I hope I’m not interrupting,” Hecate added.
4398-“No, just…working,” Persephone said.
4400-“How is everyone?” she hedged.
4401-“Sad,” Hecate said, and Persephone felt a pang in her chest.
4402-“You’re really not one to beat around the bush, are you, Hecate?”
4403-“Come back,” she said.
4404-Her eyes burned. “You know I can’t.”
4405-“What does it matter that you found each other through this contract?” Hecate asked.
4406-Persephone’s eyes widened, and she looked at the Goddess of Witchcraft. “Did he tell you?”
4407-“I asked.”
4408-“Then you know he deceived me.”
4409-“Did he? As I recall, he told you your contract had nothing to do with Aphrodite’s wager.”
4410-“You cannot tell me that he didn’t consider I might help him fulfill his contract with her.”
4411-“I am sure he considered it, but only because he was already in love with you. Was it so wrong for him to hope?”
4417-She felt Hecate watching her, and the goddess asked, “How do you think you fulfilled the terms of your contract?”
4418-Persephone looked at her, confused. “I…grew something.”
4420-The goddess shook her head. “No. You fulfilled the contract because you created life within Hades. Because you brought life to the Underworld.”
4422-“It is bleak without you.” She took Persephone’s hand. “Do you love him?”
4423-“Yes.” She sniffed. “Yes. I think I’ve loved him since the beginning. That’s why it hurts.”
4425-“So go to him. Tell him why you hurt. Tell him how to fix it. Isn’t that what you’re good at?”
4426-Persephone couldn’t help laughing at that and then groaned, rubbing her eyes. “Oh, Hecate. He doesn’t want to see me.”
4427-“How do you know?” she asked.
4428-“Don’t you think if he wanted me, he would have come for me?”
4429-“Perhaps he was just giving you time,” she said.
4436-“Hecate!” Persephone stood and threw her arms around the goddess’s neck. “I missed you.”
4437-“I missed you too, my dear.” She pulled away and studied Persephone’s face, her brows knitted together over her caring eyes. “We all do.”
4438-She’d essentially been avoiding everyone. “Sit with me?”
4439-“Of course.” The Goddess of Witchcraft took a seat beside Persephone.
4441-“I hope I’m not interrupting,” Hecate added.
4442-“No, just…working,” Persephone said.
4444-“How is everyone?” she hedged.
4445-“Sad,” Hecate said, and Persephone felt a pang in her chest.
4446-“You’re really not one to beat around the bush, are you, Hecate?”
4447-“Come back,” she said.
4448-Her eyes burned. “You know I can’t.”
4449-“What does it matter that you found each other through this contract?” Hecate asked.
4450-Persephone’s eyes widened, and she looked at the Goddess of Witchcraft. “Did he tell you?”
4451-“I asked.”
4452-“Then you know he deceived me.”
4453-“Did he? As I recall, he told you your contract had nothing to do with Aphrodite’s wager.”
4454-“You cannot tell me that he didn’t consider I might help him fulfill his contract with her.”
4455-“I am sure he considered it, but only because he was already in love with you. Was it so wrong for him to hope?”
4461-She felt Hecate watching her, and the goddess asked, “How do you think you fulfilled the terms of your contract?”
4462-Persephone looked at her, confused. “I…grew something.”
4464-The goddess shook her head. “No. You fulfilled the contract because you created life within Hades. Because you brought life to the Underworld.”
4466-“It is bleak without you.” She took Persephone’s hand. “Do you love him?”
4467-“Yes.” She sniffed. “Yes. I think I’ve loved him since the beginning. That’s why it hurts.”
4469-“So go to him. Tell him why you hurt. Tell him how to fix it. Isn’t that what you’re good at?”
4470-Persephone couldn’t help laughing at that and then groaned, rubbing her eyes. “Oh, Hecate. He doesn’t want to see me.”
4471-“How do you know?” she asked.
4472-“Don’t you think if he wanted me, he would have come for me?”
4473-“Perhaps he was just giving you time,” she said.
4477-“I missed you,” he whispered.
4478-“I missed you too,” she said and then pulled back.
4478-She studied his face, brushing the curve of his cheek and the bow of his lips. “I’m sorry.”
4479-“As am I,” he said, and she realized he was examining her just as intently, like he was trying to memorize every part of her. “I love you. I should have told you sooner. I should have told you that night in the bath. I knew then.”
4480-She smiled, her fingers coiling into his hair. “I love you too.”
4482-“I wish to claim my favor, Goddess,” he said, his eyes darkening.
4484-“Come to the Underworld with me.”
4486-“Live between worlds,” he said. “But do not leave us forever—my people, your people…me.”
4488-Her smile turned mischievous, and she smoothed his shirt. “I’m eager for a game of cards.”
4489-“Poker?” he asked.
4490-“Yes.”
4491-“The stakes?”
4492-“Your clothes,” she answered.
4497-“Oh, so the desk isn’t just for show.” A smile curled her lips, and for a moment, she was unburdened by the reason she’d come here.
4499-“I can be very productive when I wish,” he said.
4500-“Oh?”
4501-“Yes, as you are aware, darling, I am exceptional at multitasking,” he said, and the air thickened with an electric pulse she felt in her gut.
4502-“Hmm. I seem to have forgotten you possessed that particular skill. Perhaps you can enlighten me?”
4503-Hades’s fingers fisted but he did not move, eyes falling to the plant she cradled in her arms. “Have you brought me something?”
4505-Persephone placed the mint plant on the edge of Hades’s desk. “Actually, I’m returning what was already yours.”
4506-Hades’s brows knitted together over his coal-black eyes. “I think I would remember leaving a mint plant at your home, Persephone.”
4507-“Well, you see, this…plant wasn’t always a plant.”
4509-“She was a nymph. Minthe.”
4514-“is my assistant?”
4515-“Yes.”
4516-He didn’t look at the plant but at her. “And why is my assistant a plant, Persephone?”
4517-“Because”—She averted her eyes and admitted—“She upset me. “She upset me.”
4518-Hades waited, his silence questioning, and when she said nothing more, he asked, “What did Minthe do to upset you?”
4520-“That doesn’t matter anymore. I took care of it.” Hades raised a brow, and before he could say anything else, she continued. “I thought I would give you the option of returning her to her true form.”
4521-He was clearly amused, and her anxiety lessened. “You wish for me to make that decision?”
4522-She blinked and said, “She’s your assistant.”
4524-“How shall I convince you to tell me the truth?” His voice was low, husky.
4525-“Are you asking to play?”
4527-“I’m multitasking,” he said as his hands slid up her thighs and under her dress.
4531-“Do you like that?” he asked, moving in and out, the friction of his fingers driving her to the edge of a cliff she would kill to fall off.
4532-“Yes,” she breathed.
4533-“Tell me what you want.”
4534-“More. Harder,” she said, breathless. “Faster.”
4536-For a moment, she thought someone might be approaching the office, but when Hades made no move to help cover her, she knew something else was amiss. “Why did you stop?”
4537-“Tell me why you snapped,” he said. “What did she say to upset you?”
4538-Persephone glared at him. “This is your game?”
4539-“You think this is a game?”
4547-“Persephone—”
4548-His eyes darkened, his jaw tightened, and her name came out as a warning. “Persephone.”
4549-“Yes, my lord?” she asked innocently.
4550-“What are you doing?”
4552-“What does it look like?” she asked.
4554-“Tell me what you want,” she whispered as she nibbled his ear.
4555-Hades growled, “You, Goddess.”
4557-“Is it torturous?” she asked.
4559-“To take pleasure from me and not give it in return?”
4560-Standing naked before him, she asked, “What do you want, Hades?”
4565-Once their breathing returned, Persephone pulled away and met Hades’s gaze. “You will not use sex to get what you want, do you understand?”
4566-“Yes, my queen.”
4568-“But I will tell you what I want,” he said quickly. “An answer when I ask for it.”
4569-Persephone reddened. “Why? Don’t you trust me?”
4570-“I could ask the same of you.”
4571-Persephone looked away. “It’s not so easy to answer you.”
4572-“Why?” She was quiet, and Hades touched her chin, drawing her eyes back to his. “Are you ashamed?”
4573-It took her a moment, and then she said, “I was angry and rash in my decision, but she questioned my power and I thought I’d teach her just how powerful I was.”
4575-“If you had not punished her, I would have for leading you to Tartarus.”
4576-Persephone looked at him, surprised. “You knew?”
4577-“I suspected,” he said. “You confirmed.”
4578-She glared at him, swatting at his arm. “That’s deceptive.”
4579-Hades chuckled but grew more serious. “Still, why protect her when she put you in danger?”
4580-“I wasn’t protecting her. I was handling her on my own. I don’t want you to fight my battles, Hades.”
4581-“My lady, it is very clear to me that you do not need my helping fighting your battles.” Hades helped Persephone dress, and once their appearances were restored, he snapped his fingers, and Minthe the mint plant appeared in his hand. “Now, what shall we do with her?”
4582-“I haven’t completely forgiven her,” Persephone admitted. “But I should like to provide her with at least one comfort, and that’s to be returned to the Underworld.”
4583-Hades observed a few wilted leaves on the mint plant. “Is that because you have neglected her in the Upperworld?”
4584-“No!” Persephone snapped defensively, and Hades laughed. “If you must know, I spend more time here anyway. I’d rather she not die under my watch.”
4585-Hades, still smiling, kissed the top of her head. “As you wish, darling.”
4590-“Hades… I want to ask that you not call me my—”
4591-“Lady?”
4592-“Queen,” she said.
4594-She hurried to continue. “I recognize you spoke in a moment of passion—”
4595-“I meant it,” he said. “You are my queen. Only you hold sway over me.”
4596-“Hades—”
4597-“Why do you fear it? The title?”
4598-“It’s not fear; it’s…” She couldn’t find words. “Your people already call me their queen. Don’t you think it’s a little…too early?”
4599-“So it is fear,” he said. “Fear that you and I will not work.”
4601-“My people will always see you as their mistress because of how you have treated them, whether you choose to love me or not.” His words made her heart hurt.
4601-She wanted to tell him that she did love him, but he continued. “As for me, well—you will always be the ruler of my heart.”
4602-“You cannot know that,” she said.
4603-“I have waited lifetimes for you,” he said as if it was an oath he was swearing upon every star in the sky, every drop of water in the ocean, every soul in the entire universe. “I know it.”
4608-“This is beautiful,” she said.
4610-“I am glad you think so,” he said. “Because it is yours. Welcome to the Grove of Persephone.”
4611-She had to look at him now, shock evident upon her face. “But—”
4612-“I thought you might like to have a place to yourself—somewhere to practice your magic. A place that doesn’t…remind you of our beginning.”
4614-“Hades, I love our beginning.” He smiled faintly, but she could tell he didn’t believe her, and that was painful too.
4614-So she explained, “It’s true I haven’t always loved it, but I could never hate anything that brought me to you.”
4616-He stared at her, eyes burning into hers, and swore fiercely, “You will be my queen. I do not need the Fates to tell me that.”
4628-“Please spare me, my lord,” the man begged. “I did not know.”
4631-“Your death is not imminent,” Hades said, and the mortal looked up. “But I will have words with your employer.”
4632-“My employer?”
4634-“Sisyphus de Ephyra.”
4635-“H-he’s not here.”
4639-“I do not need your aid to enter that warehouse,” Hades said. “What I need from you is an example.”
4640-“A-an example?”
4644-“Sis, i-i-it wasn’t my fault,” the man said as he stumbled forward. “I—”
4646-“He was not wrong,” Hades said.
4647-“I did not kill him because he let you enter my property. I killed him because he has disrespected a god.”
4649-“Is this your version of a sacrifice?”
4650-“Depends,” the man replied, cracking his neck and handing his gun to the bodyguard on the right. “Do you accept?”
4651-“No.”
4652-“Then it was business.”
4654-“Shall we?” The mortal gestured for Hades to walk in front, toward an office on the opposite side of the yard. “Divine first.”
4655-“I insist,” Hades declined.
4659-“Very well, my lord.” The mortal offered a cold smile before starting toward his office, the two bodyguards in tow.
4664-“Bourbon?” Sisyphus asked as he uncorked the decanter.
4665-“No.”
4666-He took a sip and asked, “To what do I owe the pleasure?”
4668-“I know you are hiding drugs in your pools,” Hades said. “I also know that you use this company as a front to move them across New Greece and that you kill anyone who gets in the way.”
4669-Sisyphus stared at Hades for a moment, and then took a slow sip from his glass before asking, “Have you come to take my life?”
4670-“No.”
4674-“Then should I assume you want a cut?”
4675-Hades tilted his head to the side. “Of sorts.”
4676-Sisyphus chuckled. “Who would have thought, the God of the Dead came to bargain.”
4678-“As penance for your crimes, you will donate half your income to the homeless. You are, after all, responsible for many of them.”
4680-“Is penance not served in the afterlife?” Sisyphus asked.
4681-“Consider it a favor. I am allowing you an early start.”
4682-Sisyphus used his tongue to pick between his teeth, then he snickered quietly. “You know they never describe you as a righteous god.”
4683-“I am not righteous.”
4684-“Forcing crooks like myself to donate to charities is righteous.”
4685-“It is balance. A price you pay for the evil you spread.”
4688-“He was not wrong,” Hades said.
4689-“I did not kill him because he let you enter my property. I killed him because he has disrespected a god.”
4691-“Is this your version of a sacrifice?”
4692-“Depends,” the man replied, cracking his neck and handing his gun to the bodyguard on the right. “Do you accept?”
4693-“No.”
4694-“Then it was business.”
4696-“Shall we?” The mortal gestured for Hades to walk in front, toward an office on the opposite side of the yard. “Divine first.”
4697-“I insist,” Hades declined.
4701-“Very well, my lord.” The mortal offered a cold smile before starting toward his office, the two bodyguards in tow.
4706-“Bourbon?” Sisyphus asked as he uncorked the decanter.
4707-“No.”
4708-He took a sip and asked, “To what do I owe the pleasure?”
4710-“I know you are hiding drugs in your pools,” Hades said. “I also know that you use this company as a front to move them across New Greece and that you kill anyone who gets in the way.”
4711-Sisyphus stared at Hades for a moment, and then took a slow sip from his glass before asking, “Have you come to take my life?”
4712-“No.”
4716-“Then should I assume you want a cut?”
4717-Hades tilted his head to the side. “Of sorts.”
4718-Sisyphus chuckled. “Who would have thought, the God of the Dead came to bargain.”
4720-“As penance for your crimes, you will donate half your income to the homeless. You are, after all, responsible for many of them.”
4722-“Is penance not served in the afterlife?” Sisyphus asked.
4723-“Consider it a favor. I am allowing you an early start.”
4724-Sisyphus used his tongue to pick between his teeth, then he snickered quietly. “You know they never describe you as a righteous god.”
4725-“I am not righteous.”
4726-“Forcing crooks like myself to donate to charities is righteous.”
4727-“It is balance. A price you pay for the evil you spread.”
4729-“But you are not the God of Balance. You are the God of the Dead.”
4731-“I’ll tell you what.” He put the cigarette to his lips and lit it.
4731-The smell of nicotine filled the small shop—ashy, stale, and chemical. “I’ll donate one million, and I won’t violate the law of Xenia anymore.”
4735-“On second thought, you have a deal, Lord Hades,” Sisyphus said. “Two hundred and fifty million it is.”
4736-“Three,” Hades replied.
4737-Defiance flashed in the mortal’s eyes. “That is more than half my income.”
4738-“A punishment for wasting my time,” Hades said.
4738-He looked over his shoulder at the mortal. “And I would not worry about breaking the law of Xenia, mortal. You don’t have much time left.”
4740-“Tell me something,” he said. “Why do it? Bargain and balance? Have you hope for humanity?”
4741-“Have you none?” Hades countered.
4742-“I live among mortals, Lord Hades. Trust me, when given the choice to tip the scale one way or the other, they’ll choose darkness. It’s the fastest path with the quickest benefit.”
4743-“And the most to lose,” Hades said. “Do not educate me on the nature of mortals, Sisyphus. I have judged your kind for a millennium.”
4746-“Wake,” he commanded.
4751-“You’re late.”
4754-“How can I be late, Minthe, when I abide by no one’s schedule but my own?”
4756-“Tardiness is not attractive, Hades, even from a god,” she snapped.
4758-“While you were dallying”—Hades narrowed his eyes at the jab—“I’ve had to entertain your guests. “I’ve had to entertain your guests.”
4759-Hades’s brows furrowed and dread crawled up the back of his throat. “Who is waiting for me?”
4761-“Lady Aphrodite.”
4762-“Fuck,” Hades muttered.
4764-“You might want to hurry,” she said. “When I insisted she wait for you here, she said there was plenty to entertain her downstairs.”
4766-He sighed. “Thank you, Minthe.”
4768-“Shall I bring you a drink, my lord?”
4769-“Yes. In fact, I am not to have an empty glass tonight.”
4774-“Why don’t we go back to my place, baby?” the man asked as his hands explored Aphrodite’s body, moving across her ribs and over her thighs.
4775-“Oh, I really would like to stay just a little longer,” Aphrodite was saying. “Don’t you want to bargain with Hades?”
4776-The man squeezed her, fingers digging into her bottom. “Not anymore. You’re everything I need.”
4777-“Really?” Aphrodite said breathlessly, and leaned closer, her pink lips inches from his.
4779-“What were you missing before?”
4782-“I’m insecure. I need to know I am still wanted by other women.”
4783-“And it isn’t enough to be wanted by your wife?” Aphrodite’s pretty lips twisted into a scowl.
4784-“I love my wife,” he said. “I’m just looking for sex.”
4785-“Is that all?” She batted her lashes and then spoke in a voice veiled with darkness and strong with promise. “In that case, when you return to your wife this evening, she will no longer desire you. She will cringe at your touch and gag when your lips touch hers. She will refuse you, she will leave you, and you will never recover.”
4789-“Aphrodite,” he greeted, dropping his glamour.
4791-“Hades,” she purred in a sensual voice, and even though she had just cursed the mortal she was still using as an armchair, his eyes clouded with desire at the sound.
4792-“I think the mortal has had enough excitement for one night. Why don’t you let him slither off ?”
4793-Aphrodite’s face changed at the mention of the cheater, and she turned to glare at him before hopping off his lap. “Run along, snake.”
4795-“What?” Aphrodite snapped when she looked at Hades again.
4796-His brows rose, surprised by her venom. “Nothing. Although you will hardly help the man’s ego by taking away the only love he has ever known.”
4797-She dusted off her hands. “He betrayed love, so he will never have it again.”
4798-“I don’t think your punishment is unfair,” Hades explained. “But it has the potential to create a monster.”
4799-She smirked, her expression impish. “Then he’s all yours. Monsters are your territory, Hades.”
4801-“Lady Aphrodite,” Minthe said as she passed the goddess a glass of rosé. “Lord Hades.”
4803-“Yes?” he inquired at her questioning stare.
4804-“That nymph wants to fuck you,” she said.
4806-Hades did not acknowledge her comment and instead said, “You do not often grace my halls with your presence, Aphrodite. What can I do for you?”
4807-She took a sip of wine, her seafoam eyes locked with his. “I had hoped you’d be interested in a bargain of our own.”
4808-“I do not play gods.”
4809-“Are you afraid?”
4810-“A game played under this roof is never just a game.” Not even for me, he thought.
4810-He did not trust what Aphrodite would ask for. “Why request a game? What is it you want, goddess?”
4811-“Why must I want something?” she asked. “Perhaps I am just bored and in need of entertainment.”
4812-“There is nothing more dangerous than a bored Aphrodite,” Hades mused.
4813-She pouted. “Please, Hades?”
4815-“No, Aphrodite.”
4817-“Fine.” She lifted her chin in defiance. “You forced my hand.”
4819-“I have an unclaimed favor from you, Hades. I wish to use it.”
4821-“You would waste a favor on a game of cards?” he asked.
4822-Her eyes flashed. “It is not a waste.”
4823-It kept him from saying anything he might regret before he gritted out, “One game, Aphrodite, no more.”
4824-She brightened like he had given her the stars in the sky. “Thank you, Hades.”
4826-As Hades took his seat, he offered them to Aphrodite. “Would you like to deal?”
4827-“No.” A smile curled her lips. “I’ll let you retain some power, Aidoneus.”
4829-“Blackjack, then.”
4830-“Five hands,” Aphrodite said. “Whoever wins the most sets stakes.”
4832-“What do you see when you look at my soul, Hades?” Aphrodite asked offhand, pursing her lips as he dispensed the cards again.
4834-“Why do you ask?”
4836-“Hit me,” she said, and Hades gave her another card before revealing their hands—Hades had two aces and a twelve of diamonds, Aphrodite, a bust.
4837-“I just wonder if I’m as horrible as Hephaestus seems to think.”
4840-“Have you ever told him you love him?”
4841-“What relevance does that have to my question?”
4843-“You were a gift to Hephaestus at a time when you flaunted your lovers. From his perspective, you were a reluctant bride.”
4846-“I’m not surprised Hephaestus is not interested in forcing you into monogamy.”
4849-Finally, she admitted, “I asked Zeus for a divorce. He will not grant it.”
4850-Hades’s brows rose. “Does Hephaestus know?”
4851-“I imagine he does now.”
4852-“You want Hephaestus’s love, so why ask for a divorce?”
4853-“I will not pine after him.”
4854-“You are sending mixed messages, Aphrodite. You want Hephaestus’s love, but you ask for a divorce. Have you even tried talking to him?”
4855-“Have you?” she snapped, glaring at Hades. “He might as well be mute!”
4857-“You haven’t answered my question, Hades.”
4859-“You have a beautiful soul, Aphrodite. Passionate. Determined. Romantic. But you are desperate to be loved and believe yourself unlovable.”
4861-“It’s time for terms, Hades.”
4863-“Someone does not like to lose.”
4866-“That’s it! Make someone fall in love with you!”
4868-“Is this your idea of a joke?” he asked, his voice quiet and calm, despite the anger twisting his insides.
4869-“Not a joke,” she said, raising a thin blond brow. “You’ve offered love advice. Follow it.”
4871-“And if I can’t meet those terms?”
4873-“Then you will release Basil from the Underworld.”
4874-“Your lover?” Hades could not keep the disgust from his voice.
4874-Basil had fought and died for her in the Great War. “Why? Don’t you want Hephaestus to admit that he loves you?”
4875-She glared at him. “Hephaestus is a lost cause.”
4876-“You haven’t even tried!”
4877-“Basil, Hades. He is who I want.”
4878-“Because you imagine yourself in love with him?”
4879-“What do you know of love? You’ve never loved in your lifetime.”
4881-“Basil loves you, that is true, but if you don’t love him in return, it is meaningless.”
4882-“Better to be loved than not at all,” she countered.
4883-Instead, he asked, “Are you sure this is what you want? You have already petitioned Zeus for a divorce. Now you have asked me to resurrect your lover in the event I cannot meet the terms of your contract. Hephaestus will know.”
4885-“Yes. It is what I want.” She took a deep breath then and managed a smile. “Six months, Hades. That should be enough time. Thank you for the entertainment. It was…invigorating.”
4911-“Distracted, my lord?” she purred, amused.
4912-“Minthe,” he snapped, releasing her arms. “Can I help you?”
4914-“Already zeroing in on your prey?” she asked.
4916-“Listening in the shadows again, Minthe?”
4917-The nymph shrugged. “It is what I do.”
4918-“You gather information for me,” he said. “Not on me.”
4919-“How else am I supposed to keep you out of trouble?”
4920-He snorted. “I’m millions of years old. I can take care of myself.”
4921-“Is that how you ended up in a bargain with Aphrodite?”
4922-He narrowed his gaze, then lifted his glass. “Did I not tell you I am not to have an empty glass tonight?”
4923-She gave her best fuck you smile and bowed. “Right away, my lord.”
4927-“Your drink, my lord,” Ilias said.
4931-Hades took the glass, and before he thought too long on the subject, said, “I have a job for you.”
4932-“Yes, my lord?”
4934-“That woman, I want to know if she leaves with anyone.”
4935-Silence followed Hades’s order, and when the god looked at Ilias, he was staring back, brow raised. “Is she in danger, my lord?”
4940-“My lord?” Ilias asked, sensing the sudden change in him.
4943-“Lord Hades?”
4944-“Yes,” the god finally answered, looking at Ilias as he turned from the floor. “Yes, she is in danger.”
4956-“My lord,” she said.
4960-“Your sense of smell amazes me, Euryale.”
4961-“You make it too easy,” the gorgon replied. “Lay off the cologne.”
4972-“Do you play?” he asked.
4975-After a moment, she smiled, a playful glint in her gaze. “I’m willing to play if you’re willing to teach.”
4979-“It’s brave to sit down at a table without knowing the game,” he said.
4980-He thought that she might have sensed the warning in his tone, because she arched a brow at him and asked, “How else would I learn?”
4981-“Hmm.”
4983-“Clever.”
4986-“I have never seen you before,” he finally said, hoping that explained his stare.
4987-“Well, I have never been here before,” she replied, and then narrowed her eyes. “You must come here often.”
4989-“I do.”
4990-“Why?” She sounded curious rather than disgusted, then blushed and tried to recover by adding, “I mean—you don’t have to answer that. “I mean—you don’t have to answer that.”
4991-“I will answer it.” He met her gaze, challenging. “If you will answer a question for me.”
4994-“Fine,” she conceded.
4996-He answered her earlier question, “I come because it is…fun.”
4998-“Now you—why are you here tonight?”
4999-“My friend Lexa was on the list,” she explained, looking at her hands as she twined her fingers together in her lap.
5000-“No,” he said. “That is the answer to a different question. Why are you here tonight?”
5002-“It seemed rebellious at the time,” she answered finally.
5003-“And now you aren’t so sure?”
5004-“Oh, I am sure it is rebellious,” she said as her fingers trailed the felt table.
5005-“I’m just not sure how I’ll feel about it tomorrow.”
5006-Now he was curious. “Who are you rebelling against?”
5007-Her smile was like an arrow to his chest—devastating, secretive, enticing. “You said one question.”
5008-“So I did.”
5011-“Are you cold?”
5012-“What?” She seemed surprised by his question.
5013-“You’ve been shivering since I sat down.”
5014-She flushed, fidgeted under his gaze again, and then blurted, “Who was that woman with you earlier?”
5015-He frowned but then remembered. “Oh, Minthe. She’s always putting her hands where they don’t belong.”
5017-“I…think I should go.”
5020-“No,” he said, but it came out as a command, and she glared at him.
5021-“Excuse me?”
5022-“What I mean to say is, I haven’t taught you how to play yet.” He lowered his voice, forcing away the hysteria that had caused him to reach for her. “Allow me.”
5025-Finally, she seemed resolved and relaxed, lowered her lashes as she spoke in the most erotic voice he had ever heard, “Then teach me.”
5027-He shuffled the cards and explained the game. “This is poker. We will play five-card draw, and we’ll start with a bet.”
5028-“But I don’t have anything to bet with,” she said, glancing down at herself.
5030-“A question answered, then. If I win, you will answer any question I pose, and if you win, I will answer yours.”
5032-“Deal.”
5034-“There are ten rankings in poker. The lowest is the high card and the highest is the royal flush. The goal is to draw a higher rank than the other player…” he expounded. “If you are dealt a bad hand, fold. It is better than the alternative. Checking and calling would apply if we were playing for coin, but since our currency is answers, the point is moot. Perhaps the most important skill in poker is your ability to bluff.”
5035-“Bluff ?” That seemed to pique her interest.
5036-“Sometimes, poker is just a game of deception…especially when you’re losing.”
5038-“You have a pair of queens,” he said. “And I have a full house.”
5039-“So…you win.” She didn’t seem upset so much as contemplative, still trying to remember the rules and understand the game.
5040-“Who are you rebelling against?”
5041-She smiled wryly. “My mother.”
5042-He raised a brow. “Why?”
5043-“You’ll have to win another hand if I’m going to answer.”
5045-“Because…” She paused, and her eyes moved away from his, focusing on the table in front of them, brows furrowing.
5045-She smiled ruefully as she said, “She made me mad.”
5047-“You never said the answer had to be detailed.”
5048-His grin matched hers. “Noted for the future, I assure you.”
5049-“The future?”
5050-“Well, I hope this isn’t the last time we’ll play poker.”
5056-“Why are you angry with your mother?” he asked.
5057-She looked thoughtful for a moment, and then said, “Because…she wants me to be something I can’t.”
5059-Her gaze dropped to the cards. “I don’t understand why people do this.”
5060-He tilted his head. “You are not enjoying our game?”
5061-“I am. But…I don’t understand why people play Hades. Why do they want to sell their soul to him?”
5063-“They don’t agree to a game because they want to sell their soul,” he said. “They do it because they think they can win.”
5064-“Do they? Win?”
5065-“Sometimes.”
5066-“Does that anger him, you think?”
5068-“Darling, I win either way.”
5070-“Hades.”
5073-“I have to go.”
5078-“Fastest path, quickest benefit,” he muttered.
5081-“My lord.” Minthe’s voice brought him out of his reverie. “Your first appointment has arrived.”
5083-“Smitten, my lord?” Her voice dripped with judgment.
5084-“Yes,” he said.
5084-He saw no reason to lie. “I am.”
5085-Minthe’s shock registered in her eyes as they widened, then her lips flattened. “Desperation isn’t flattering, Hades.”
5086-“Neither is jealousy,” he replied, shoving the empty glass into her hands.
5088-“Where is the mortal?”
5089-Her eyes flashed as she answered, “The Diamond Suite.”
5095-“Change your terms,” he advised.
5096-Her eyes narrowed, and she gritted her teeth, daring to raise her voice. “But he is who I want!”
5098-“I cannot make another mortal love you,” Hades said. “You either ask for love or nothing.”
5100-“Cease this pointless desire for your coworker,” Hades said.
5101-She glared. “I can’t just…stop loving him.”
5102-“You must find a way,” he said. “Perhaps when you do, your eyes will be opened to a new love.”
5104-“Haven’t you ever been in love?” she asked, and when he paused, her eyes widened with the realization. “You haven’t.”
5105-Hades pressed his lips together. “Careful, mortal. This life is fleeting. Your existence in the Underworld lasts an eternity.”
5106-He started to rise again, and the woman grabbed his hand. “Please! You don’t understand! I cannot help who I love!”
5107-Hades jerked his hand away. “You waste your words and feelings, mortal.”
5115-“Would you prefer to live among the souls and deities of the Underworld?” he asked them every time they complained. “They would stone you, and I would not stop them.”
5120-“Show me who this thread belongs to,” he said, and the gold broke apart until it formed the image of the girl from Nevernight.
5123-“Curious about your future queen?” Lachesis appeared, dressed in white, her face framed with long, dark hair, her head crowned in gold.
5125-“Her name?” Hades asked.
5127-“She is called Persephone,” Lachesis replied.
5129-“The Goddess of Spring.”
5131-“You wish to taunt me.”
5133-“Ever suspicious, Hades,” Clotho said, appearing out of thin air.
5133-The youngest of the three Fates, she looked no different than Lachesis, clothed and crowned in gold. “Perhaps we wish to reward our favorite god.”
5134-“You like no gods,” Hades replied.
5135-“We dislike you least.”
5136-“Flattered,” he snapped.
5137-“If you are displeased, we will unweave the thread,” Atropos said, appearing before Hades and snatching the book from his hands.
5139-“I know you well, Morai,” he said, addressing all of them at once. “Who are you punishing?”
5140-Finally, Clotho answered, “Demeter begged for a daughter.”
5141-“A wish that was granted,” Lachesis said.
5142-“You are the price she paid,” Atropos added.
5143-“I am punishment,” Hades stated.
5145-“If that is how you prefer to perceive it,” Clotho said.
5146-“But we like to think of it differently,” Lachesis said.
5147-“It is the price paid for our favor,” Atropos explained.
5149-“Demeter is aware?” Hades asked.
5150-“Of course. We are not in the habit of keeping secrets, Lord Hades.”
5152-“You think to punish Demeter, but you are really punishing Persephone,” Hades said.
5154-Lachesis narrowed her eyes. “Are you afraid, Hades?”
5156-“We may weave the Threads of Fate, my lord, but you retain control over how your future unfolds.” Clotho vanished.
5157-“Will you rule your relationship as you rule your kingdom?” Lachesis disappeared.
5158-“Or revel in the chaos?” Atropos faded.
5166-“Do not pretend as though my poisons have not been useful, Hades.”
5167-“I have had no such thoughts,” he had replied.
5170-“What troubles you, my king?” she asked as he approached. “Is it Minthe? May I suggest lye to remedy the situation? It is quite painful when swallowed.”
5171-Hades raised a brow. “Murderous thoughts already, Hecate? It isn’t even noon yet.”
5172-She smiled. “I am more creative at night.”
5173-After a moment, she asked him again, “What troubles you?”
5174-“The Fates,” he said.
5175-“Oh, the besties. What have they done?”
5176-“They have given me a wife,” he said, raising both his brows. “Demeter’s daughter.”
5178-“S-sorry,” she said, and cleared her throat, composing herself. “Is she horrible?”
5179-“No,” Hades said. “That’s probably the worst part. She is beautiful.”
5180-“Then why are you so glum?”
5182-“You should have seen how she looked at me when she realized who I was. She was horrified.”
5183-“I doubt she was horrified,” Hecate said. “Surprised, perhaps—maybe even mortified if her thoughts were anything like yours.”
5185-“I have never known you to back down from a challenge, Hades.”
5186-“I haven’t,” he said.
5188-“She played me.”
5189-“What?”
5190-“She invited me to her table for a game, and she lost,” Hades explained.
5192-“Hades, you didn’t.”
5194-“It is Divine Law,” he said.
5196-“Do you not want her love? Why would you force her into a contract?”
5197-After a moment, he admitted aloud, “Because I did not think she would come back.”
5199-“What will you ask of her?” she inquired.
5200-“What I ask of everyone,” he said.
5202-“How do you feel when you look at her?” Hecate asked.
5203-Hades did not like that question, or maybe he didn’t like his answer, but he spoke truthfully, nonetheless. “Like I was born from chaos.”
5205-“I can already tell I’m going to like her.” Then her eyes flashed with amusement. “You must tell Minthe you are to wed when I am present. She will be furious!”
5221-“Well, isn’t he handsome,” Hermes said, appearing in Hades’s office.
5223-“Do not ogle the prisoners, Hermes,” Hades said.
5224-“What? I can appreciate beauty.”
5225-“With your track record? No. You tend to forget what is beneath the skin.”
5226-“I also tend to have mind-blowing sex,” Hermes said, sighing. “It is a sacrifice I’m willing to make.”
5228-“Perhaps if you got laid more often, you wouldn’t feel the need to torture your subjects,” Hermes said.
5231-“Has anyone ever told you, you might need therapy?” Hermes asked. “Because I’m pretty sure torturing people is a sign of psychopathy.”
5234-“What?” he challenged. “It scared me!”
5235-Hades swiped the cattle prod from the ground and turned toward the man named Isidore sitting in the center of his office, then said, “Wake.”
5238-“Welcome to my realm,” Hades said.
5239-Isidore’s eyes widened. “Am I…am I in Tartarus?”
5240-Instead, he said, “You are Impious.”
5242-“And a loyal member of Triad,” Hades added.
5244-“Tr-Triad? What makes you think I’m a member of Triad?”
5246-“Three reasons,” Hades said. “One, you stutter when you lie. Second, even if you did not stutter when you lie, I can sense lies. Yours are bitter and they taste like ash, a mark of your soul. Third, if you do not want to advertise your allegiance, you should not tattoo it upon your skin.”
5248-“So, you will torture me for my allegiance?”
5249-“I will torture you for your crimes,” Hades said. “The fact that you are a member of Triad is merely a bonus.”
5251-“Gods, Hades! Do you really have to do this?” Hermes asked, but he made no move to cover his eyes or even look disgusted.
5252-“Don’t pretend you haven’t tortured a mortal, Hermes. We all know differently,” Hades spat.
5253-As the cattle prod sparked again, the man glared at Hades and challenged, “I’ve been tortured before.”
5254-Hades smiled wickedly. “Not by me.”
5256-At some point, Hades doused the flames with his magic, and in the quiet aftermath, Hermes spoke. “You are seriously fucked up, Hades.”
5257-“You,” Isidore’s voice rasped, his chest rose and fell slowly. “You think you are untouchable because you are gods.”
5258-“That’s exactly why we are untouchable,” Hermes said.
5260-“You don’t know what is coming,” Isidore continued, voice hollow.
5261-“Um, Hades—” Hermes started to say.
5262-“What’s coming?” Hades demanded.
5263-“War,” the man answered.
5266-“You could have told me you were torturing him for information,” Hermes complained.
5267-“Are you saying if I had told you, you would have refrained from telling me how fucked up I am?” Hades asked.
5268-Hermes opened his mouth to reply, but Hades spoke instead—a rare occasion. “Triad is reorganizing. I need your eyes and ears.”
5269-Hermes laughed. “You aren’t actually…afraid of them, are you?”
5270-“We went to war with Triad, Hermes. It could happen again. Do not underestimate mortals desperate for freedom.”
5271-Hermes narrowed his eyes. “It sounds like you sympathize with them.”
5272-Hades met the god’s gaze and answered as he always did, “What is evil to one is a fight for freedom to another.”
5274-“Do not let your hubris blind you, Hermes.”
5284-“Go away,” he said, thinking it had to be Minthe.
5285-Instead, Ilias’s voice answered. “Oh, I think you’ll want to hear this, my lord.”
5286-Hades sighed. “Yes?”
5287-Ilias entered, arching a dark brow and smiling wryly. “No rest for the wicked. The woman from last night is outside Nevernight fighting with Duncan. He has placed his hands upon her. You had better hurry.”
5290-“Why didn’t you say something sooner?” he snapped before teleporting to the entrance of Nevernight.
5291-On the other side of the door, a familiar voice threatened, “I am Persephone, Goddess of Spring, and if you would like to keep your fleeting life, then you will obey me!”
5295-Despite feeling as if he had no control over his body, his emotions, his magic, he composed himself as best he could and spoke. “Lady Persephone.”
5297-“Lord Hades.”
5299-“My lord.” The ogre sunk to his knees and hung his head low. “I did not know she was a goddess. I accept punishment for my actions.”
5300-“Punishment?” Persephone echoed.
5301-“I laid my hands upon a goddess,” Duncan said.
5302-“And a woman at that,” Hades added unhappily.
5305-“I will deal with you later,” Hades promised. “Now, Lady Persephone.”
5309-“You are full of surprises, darling.”
5313-“After you, goddess.”
5317-“Where are we going?” she asked.
5320-“My office,” he said. “I imagine that whatever you have to say to me demands privacy?”
5321-She raised a brow, glancing at the empty space. “This seems pretty private.”
5322-“It isn’t.” He turned and headed upstairs, pleased when he heard the click of her heels following.
5324-“Will you hesitate at every turn, Lady Persephone?”
5325-She scowled. “I was just admiring your decor, Lord Hades. I didn’t notice this last night.”
5326-“The doors to my quarters are often veiled during business hours,” he replied, and then indicated to the open door. “Shall we?”
5333-“Are you hurt?” he asked.
5334-“No,” she whispered.
5337-“Oh, it’s a little too late to be modest, don’t you think?” he asked, leaning against his desk, tugging his tie free from his neck.
5338-“Did I interrupt something?”
5339-Instead, his lips curled as he explained, “I was just about to go to bed when I heard you demanding entrance to my club. Imagine my surprise when I found the goddess from last night on my doorstep.”
5340-She glowered, “Did the gorgon tell you?”
5341-“No, Euryale did not. I recognized your magic as Demeter’s, but you are not Demeter.” He tilted his head, studying her like he’d studied her image in the Library of Souls. “When you left, I consulted a few texts. I had forgotten Demeter had a daughter. I assumed you were Persephone. Question is, why aren’t you using your own magic?”
5342-“Is that why you did this?” she demanded, removing a hideous set of bracelets from her wrist and holding up her arm, where a band of black dots marked her skin.
5343-Instead, he focused on the mark on her skin, his mark, and smirked. “No. That is the result of losing against me.”
5344-“You were teaching me to play!”
5345-“Semantics.” He shrugged. “The rules of Nevernight are very clear, goddess.”
5346-“They are anything but clear.” She threw up her hands and then pointed at him. “And you are an asshole!”
5348-“Don’t call me names, Persephone,” he said, grasping her wrist gently.
5349-“When you invited me to your table, you entered into an agreement. If you had won, you could have left Nevernight with no demands on your time. But you did not, and now we have a contract.”
5355-She spoke, her words dripped with restrained anger. “What does that mean?”
5356-“It means I must choose terms,” he said, certain.
5358-“I don’t want to be in a contract with you,” she said between her teeth, her beautiful eyes flashing bright. “Take it off !”
5359-“I can’t.”
5361-“You put it there. You can remove it.”
5363-“You think this is funny?” she demanded.
5364-“Oh, darling, you have no idea.”
5365-“I am a goddess. We are equals.”
5367-“You think our blood changes the fact that you willingly entered into a contract with me? These things are law, Persephone.” She glared at him. “The mark will dissolve when the contract has been fulfilled.”
5368-“And what are your terms?”
5370-“Create life in the Underworld.”
5372-“What?”
5373-“Create life in the Underworld,” he said again. “You have six months. If you fail or refuse, then you will become a permanent resident of my realm.”
5374-“You want me to grow a garden in your realm?”
5376-He shrugged. “I suppose that is one way to create life.”
5378-“If you steal me away to the Underworld, you will face my mother’s wrath.”
5379-“Oh, I am sure,” he mused, imagining it now, and yet it was the price Demeter would pay—first for bargaining with the Fates, and second for hiding Persephone from him.
5379-When would the Goddess of Harvest come for him? he wondered. “Much like you will feel her wrath when she discovers what you’ve so recklessly done.”
5381-“Fine. When do I start?”
5382-He almost smiled. “Come tomorrow. I’ll show you the way to the Underworld.”
5383-“It will have to be after class,” she said.
5384-His brows drew together. “Class?”
5385-“I’m a student at New Athens University.”
5388-“After…class, then.”
5390-“What about your bouncer?” she asked suddenly.
5391-Hades frowned, brows lowering. “What about him?”
5392-“I’d prefer he not remember me in this form.” She lifted her hand to her horns, and Hades’s eyes followed.
5393-“I’ll erase his memory…after he is punished for his treatment of you,” he promised.
5394-“He didn’t know I was a goddess,” she said.
5396-“But he knew you were a woman, and he let his anger get the best of him. So he will be punished.”
5398-“What will it cost me?”
5400-“Clever, darling. You know how this works. The punishment? Nothing. His memory? A favor.”
5401-“Don’t call me darling,” she snapped, and he raised a brow at her sudden frustration.
5401-Perhaps she thought he was growing too comfortable too fast. “What kind of favor?”
5402-“Whatever I want,” he said. “To be used at a future time.”
5404-“Deal.”
5406-Despite his worrying thoughts, Hades smiled at her. “I will have my driver take you home.”
5407-“That’s not necessary.”
5408-“It is,” he insisted.
5410-“Fine,” she snapped.
5415-“What was that for?” she whispered.
5417-“For your benefit. Next time, the door will open for you. I would rather you not piss Duncan off. If he hurts you again, I will have to kill him, and it’s hard to find a good ogre.”
5418-“Lord Hades,” Minthe’s voice interrupted. “Thanatos is looking for you—oh!”
5420-“Fine. When do I start?”
5421-He almost smiled. “Come tomorrow. I’ll show you the way to the Underworld.”
5422-“It will have to be after class,” she said.
5423-His brows drew together. “Class?”
5424-“I’m a student at New Athens University.”
5427-“After…class, then.”
5429-“What about your bouncer?” she asked suddenly.
5430-Hades frowned, brows lowering. “What about him?”
5431-“I’d prefer he not remember me in this form.” She lifted her hand to her horns, and Hades’s eyes followed.
5432-“I’ll erase his memory…after he is punished for his treatment of you,” he promised.
5433-“He didn’t know I was a goddess,” she said.
5435-“But he knew you were a woman, and he let his anger get the best of him. So he will be punished.”
5437-“What will it cost me?”
5439-“Clever, darling. You know how this works. The punishment? Nothing. His memory? A favor.”
5440-“Don’t call me darling,” she snapped, and he raised a brow at her sudden frustration.
5440-Perhaps she thought he was growing too comfortable too fast. “What kind of favor?”
5441-“Whatever I want,” he said. “To be used at a future time.”
5443-“Deal.”
5445-Despite his worrying thoughts, Hades smiled at her. “I will have my driver take you home.”
5446-“That’s not necessary.”
5447-“It is,” he insisted.
5449-“Fine,” she snapped.
5454-“What was that for?” she whispered.
5456-“For your benefit. Next time, the door will open for you. I would rather you not piss Duncan off. If he hurts you again, I will have to kill him, and it’s hard to find a good ogre.”
5457-“Lord Hades,” Minthe’s voice interrupted. “Thanatos is looking for you—oh!”
5459-“I did not know you had company,” Minthe said, her voice dripping with judgment.
5460-“A minute, Minthe,” Hades gritted out without looking at her.
5462-“You haven’t answered my question. Why are you using your mother’s magic?”
5464-“Lord Hades,” she said, her voice breathy and sensual.
5464-Did she know her power? “The only way you are getting answers from me is if I decide to enter into another gamble with you, and at the moment, it’s not likely.”
5465-Then she took the lapels of his jacket and straightened them before leaning in, much like he had done earlier in the foyer, and whispered, “I think you will regret this, Hades.”
